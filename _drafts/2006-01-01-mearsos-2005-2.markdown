excerpt: My first effort at a list of enjoyable things from the last year. Obviously
  limited to what I can remember. I haven't got close to coming up with a list of
  resolutions. Maybe I should resolve to be organised enough to make resolutions!

Music
* Ladytron - Witching Hour Bloody great. Like Human league meets Kraftwerk meets My Bloody Valentine.
* Bloc Party - Silent Alarm Great choppy guitars and the remix album grows on you too.
* Two Lone Swordsmen Electronic buzzing, clicking and bleeping - fantastico!

Books
* Status anxiety - Alain De Botton "Described this earlier in the year":http://www.mearso.com/journal/239/status-anxiety
* Cloud Atlas - David Mitchell "Again reviewed elsewhere":http://www.mearso.com/journal/238/cloud-atlas

TV
* Lost -Very Good. Especially when one can watch more than one at a time
* Sky - Vast quantities of Malcolm in the Middle and the Simpsons - Not much else that you can watch and still feel good about yourself.

Gadgets
* ipod Video - Great screen - watchable screen surprised me, all I need now is a gadget to create the time for me to watch/listen to all the stuff that is backing up.

Sport
* Has to be Wales doing the Grand slam, and Lance doing the seven. From a participant point of view, wish my back was better so that I could ride more.

Trends
* Clothes - Smartened up a little, and finally get the idea that how you dress changes the way you feel, and how people feel about you.

Events
* @Media conference was great - learnt a lot and felt part of a community. Hope there will be more, but suspect that it will be a different feeling.
* Holiday to Italy has provoked lots of daydreaming about how nice it'd be to live there.
