A logo of many parts, and unfortunately none of the them work that well. The use of a Liver bird seems like an idea with some potential as other universities have managed it well, and there is a strong association in the city. It seems like the intention for the logo was to make it economical and suggestive in the style of the [BT Piper by Michael Wolff](http://www.designersjournal.net/jottings/designheroes/heroes-michael-wolff), but it's inelegantly drawn without enough of the bird for it to work successfully.

The bird is crowded out by uppercase text which looks like a slightly condensed Helvetica, all jammed together in a rectangle without a lot of space to breathe. The end result is a logo that functions, but without any real finesse.
