Simple and clear arrangement of words, without any particular theme evident. 'Guild' and 'Hall' seem to be aligned around the verticals of the 'I' and 'H', which works well enough, though I'm curious why it's been split since in general use it seems to be one word.

More puzzling is the need for the rotated 'School'. Legibility aside, it makes the overall shape of the wordmark more unusual, though if that was the intention then it seems a timid effort.
