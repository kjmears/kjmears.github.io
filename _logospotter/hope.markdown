The wikipedia page says this is the only eucumenical university in Europe, which I guess is the reason for the curious shining star in the logo. The decision to have a shining star then necessitates it being reversed out of the background, thus leading to the whole thing feeling like a label. Weirdly, the inclusion of the establishment date only adds to the effect - like the faux tradition one sees on t-shirts.
