England have always been a juggernaut of a team in my mind. At their best awe-inspiringly efficient and impossible to stop. Not pretty to look at but impressive nonetheless.

Even though their current team seems to be struggling, the rumbling nature of their play seems to be what they are famous for.

And I like that. If all the nations played the same way it'd be very dull. So I expect to do more industrial diggeresque drawings
