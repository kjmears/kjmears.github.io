After a 2 year hiatus, where I haven't written one of these, I'm taking the advice of the prolific [Jukesie][jukesie] who suggested weeknotes as a gateway drug to the underworld of [interesting][interest] and considered [blogging][footnotes].

According to my done.txt file, I logged a few links to look at - I don't have a fancy system, I just bung em in my [todo.txt][todo] file.

[Gerry McGovern's Article][gerry] about testing with the customer rang very true - both when thinking about the wider organisation I work in, and for me personally. More testing has been on my list for a long time, and I need to make proper steps to build it in.

Also had a quick look at the [CSS Tricks article on Design Systems][tricks] which though a pretty quick overview of their process, did contain some good pointers and some useful links.

I had a brief look at [Sarah Drasner's][drasner] impressive codepens - reminding me to get more into [Codepen][codepen]

Most of my effort this week has gone into a seemingly simple design for a list of events combined with a select to choose dates. It was enjoyable to design around variations in content like title, description, sometimes info not being present and multiple options. I enjoyed the challenge of making the information clear and useable, and hopefully it'll work well with the rest of the site it's on. Even if it did throughly obey [Hofstadter's law][law]

The team also had a big meeting where lots of interesting things like workflows, standard and expectations were discussed in relation to our work in support and development. I was an enthusiastic advocate of Github issues as I'm a big fan. I think the little extra work of creating and maintaining them will be well worth it - if done the extra information about all the work that comes in and how we deal with it will give us a good picture of how we're working, which I think is a crucial first step to working better.

Also the usual set of little support issues, that take a surprising amount of time - especially for someone as easily distracted as me.

I also worked out that I find it really hard to work on more that one screen. The whole, laptop plugged in to a larger monitor thing is hard. Pathetically, I can't seem to get past the horrible aesthetics of all those cables and bits of hardware not lining up.
