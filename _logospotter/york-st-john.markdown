The leaves and bud (or is it an acorn?) - I'm no expert on trees - in two tones of green are arranged to slightly suggest of a letter Y, but not too obviously so. Combined with the thin and even sans serif the overall feel is perhaps a little generic medical. The letter 'r's have some pretty distinctive shoulders (I think that's what they are called) and no dots over the 'i's is unusual.
