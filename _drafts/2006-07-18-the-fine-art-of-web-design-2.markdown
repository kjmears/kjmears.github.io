After last years @media talk I was looking to Andy's session to send me away from the conference fired up and enthusiatic about new directions for web design and  he didn't dissapoint. Being such a renaissance man it seemed too obvious not to use Da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man as the starting point.

I thoroughly enjoyed the broad sweep of design thinking that Andy made everyone think about, and a timely reminder that the field of web design relates to a bigger picture of design.
