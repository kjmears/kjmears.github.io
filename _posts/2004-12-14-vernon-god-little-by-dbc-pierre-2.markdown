Really enjoyed this book, even though I read it in small chunks over a long period of time - Something I normally hate doing.

The world weary teenage wisecracking of the central character Vernon Gregory Little was great fun, though I sometimes found the first third of the book to be a little slow. Even a bit of a tease, with the momentous events in Matirio being revealed very slowly, and Vernon's role not becoming clear until very near the end.

Once the pace picks up the book is hard to put down, and indeed I was lucky that I couldn't sleep one night and had the opportunity to read the final chapters in one go.
