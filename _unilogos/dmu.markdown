The font seems to be [Standard CT Extra Bold](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/standard/ct-extra-bold/). It's a chunky Helvetica lookalike, that is pretty compressed and solid.
The overall effect is a very confident,perhaps strident exclamation of the University, it's location and it's name. Such a dense block of type is offset a little by the stylised heraldic lion, taken from the coat of arms of Simon de Montfont. The choice of an all uppercase treatment also neatly sidesteps any confusion about the proper capitalisation of de Montfort.

Ultimately, the overall effect is of a no-nonsense and confident approach, eschewing more restrained and traditional approaches.
