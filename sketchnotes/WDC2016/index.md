Sketchnotes from my visit to Bristol for the WDC2016 conference.

My first visit back to the Watershed since I worked there one summer over 20 years ago. (I was a rubbish Barista).

Had a good time and was impressed with a nice range of formats and topics. I didn't sketchnote Gavin Strange's talk as I've seen him talk before and there was no way I was going to try to keep up with him!
