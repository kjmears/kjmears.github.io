I like the use of negative space to create interesting imagery, though some of the angles seem a bit off, so the H created is stronger on one side than the other. A shame that it's not quite working - It'd be nice if it did.

Similarly the odd angular serifs on the type are initially interesting, but on examination end up being mannered and annoying. The 'E's and the 'L are particularly nasty.
