The University changed from their old logo, that depicted [Minerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva), Roman godess of wisdom to the more specific crest of the University. In the [coverage about the changed logo](http://thelincolnite.co.uk/2012/07/university-of-lincoln-swaps-minerva-logo-for-swans/
) there's some interesting reasons for the change, and a [thorough explanation](http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/abouttheuniversity/press/identity/coatofarms/) of the coat of arms on the university website.

What at first seems a simple enough idea, it's complicated by the crest being rendered in a greyscale style that makes it pretty difficult to pick out meaningful detail. It's much more successful in the black and white version (for example, on the website).

The type is a solid enough 'classical' serif that is clear without being too dull.
