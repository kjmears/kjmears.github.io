University of Birmingham tread the familiar uppercase classical serif path chosen by other august institutions, but adds a little flair with a script-like device on the 'y'.

Seems to be [Baskerville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskerville), which has very [strong connections with the city](http://www.typographichub.org/research/entry/baskerville-project/)

The large curves that taper on the serifs make for a nice contrast throughout the letters, providing the gravitas that established universities are often looking for. The flourish on the 'of' doesn't seem incongruous and the overall effect is plain and direct.
