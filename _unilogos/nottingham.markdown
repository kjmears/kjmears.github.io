Judging by the tops of the lower case n, m and g looks to be using [FF Dax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FF_Dax) with the modification of the lower case e straightened. A fresh face without too much modulation in the strokes - interest instead coming from the way the aforementioned m's, n's and g have arcs that finish abruptly at the junction of a vertical stroke.

The castle is simply drawn with some nice details to show light coming from the right. At the bottom is I presume, a representation of the River Trent. The combination of the two window slits in the tower and the river suggest (to me at least), a slightly whimsical face.

A simple vertical line delineates the text and graphic portions of the logo, with either side anchored around it. A neat little separator for a logo that is a confident use of 'heritage' imagery with a contemporary typeface.
