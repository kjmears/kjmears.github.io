## Update

Interesting [Article](roe) about the new design. I've got a soft spot for a big 'ol single letter logo, and this is an intruiging way to break up an R whilst still harking back to the original four colleges that made up the institution - a nice touch.

In a recent [post](newman.html) I mentioned my liking for a slab serif, and a subtle one seems in use here, though the words do seem not really anchored in the same way that the R is solidy grounded. That's a very minor quibble with a strong upgrade.


## Old Review

![Old Logo](/images/unilogos/roehampton-old.gif)

Reading a little about the University and it's history I thought that the four quarters of this logo might refer to the original constituent colleges. However, checking [the infomation about them](http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/Colleges/) it seems they each have their own distinct coats of arms, which bear no relation to the graphic patterns of the main logo.

The geometric yellow, red and navy patterns of the logo remind me of [naval flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags). The yellow background combined with the black and yellow certainly give some road-sign urgency even if the reasoning is unclear.

The Typeface looks like Helvetica, and the sparse modernist feel is unfortunately a little undermined by the 'London' beneath the underline - which looks tacked on as an afterthought.
