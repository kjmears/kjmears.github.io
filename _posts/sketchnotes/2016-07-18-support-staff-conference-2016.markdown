My first time of attending the Support Staff Conference in the University of South Wales, saw me listen to a talk by Ben Calvert, The Pro Vice-Chancellor for Learning, Teaching and Student Experience. It was a lot more interesting than his rather dry title would lead you to expect.

Followed later in the day by Helen Walbey, who was a livewire speaker and passionate about the transformative power of education and a positive attitude.
