## Updated

Evolution more than revolution for the RGU logo. In this case the revolution means shedding the vaguely starbucks-like roundel, and radically simplifying to initials and what I assume are meant to be mountains, or maybe waves. It's not as subtle as the old one - which itself was pretty bold. I wonder if the emphasis on the 'RGU' is a sign of intent to push the shortened brand. Perhaps a way to acknowledge that brands have to live on screens as well as other media.

## Older review

![](./images/rgu-old.gif)

The following areas were identified in the corporate guidelines, outlining the rationale for the changes to the name and the logo.

*   Increased prominence given to our locatIon
*   Removal of the definitive article
*   Increased legibility of our coat of arms elements
*   Application of a new corporate colour to help distinguish our identity

I particularly like the very strong roundel where the parts of the University coat of arms have been brought together in a monochrome diagram that reminds me a little of a sporting badge. This feel is created by the strong uppercase around the imagery. The bespoke font (called Gordon) are is a compressed sans-serif that works well in the confines of the circle. The Os and Ds reminded me of DIN Mittelschrift and when "looking at the [DIN variations](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/din-schriften/) one can see it's almost a combination of both.

The purple is also a welcome break with the usual blues and reds the seem prevalent in the sector.

Overall, a nice tension between the commonplace crest imagery with a subtly dynamic and strong display typeface makes this an enjoyable and distinctive treatment.
