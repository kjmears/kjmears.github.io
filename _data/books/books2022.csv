Municipal Dreams,The Rise and Fall of Council Housing,John Boughton,2022/12/28,"November 6, 2022","A great introduction to a layman like me of the broad sweep of how, housing and economic policies, architecture, design, culture and poltics mix and made concrete (and other materials) in housing. Loved how accessible he made what could easily have been very dry material."
Becoming a Supple Leopard,"The Ultimate Guide to Resolving Pain,Preventing Injury and Optimizing Atheltic Performance",Dr Kelly Starrett,2022/12/06,"December 2, 2022","Flicked through and pulled some ideas. Might be good, but haven't drink the kool aid."
Empire of Pain,"The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty ",Patrick Radden Keefe,2022/12/03,"November 23, 2022","Listened to this over the course of two weeks, and I loved the way that he kept the focus on the Sacklers, and painstakingly went back through their history to catalogue what awful venal people they are. He took his time to build up a fair picture and even with that they rightly come across as monstrous. I particularly like how the slippery later generations weren't let of the hook despite their wriggling. It does still sting that they all have got off very lightly for the chaos they caused and profited from."
A Map of the World,According to Illustrators and Storytellers,"Antonis Antoniou,Robert Klanten,Sven Ehmann, Hendrick Hellige, Lincoln Dexter",2022/11/24,"November 22, 2022",Nice illustrated maps - bit a bit lacking in variety. Was considering buying this - glad I borrowed instead.
Kind of Blue,A Political memoir,Ken Clarke,2022/11/05,"November 2, 2022","His reasoned opinions on the stupidity of the Brexit referendum made me intrigued to read about him. Working class roots and then steady path through government. A bit of a hagiography, but as with many retiring politicians able to say more interesting things when the urge for power fades."
Quirkology,The Curious Science of Everyday Lives,Richard Wiseman,2022/11/01,"June 18, 2022","Women's personal ads would attract more replies if they were written by a man. The opposite is not true of men's ads.People would rather wear a sweater that has been dropped in dog faces and not washed, than one that has been dry-cleaned but used to belong to a mass murderer. Many more nuggets like that in an enjoyable book."
Record Play Pause,,Stephen Morris,2022/10/11,"October 8, 2022","Always intersting insight into music making, and a slow reveal about Stephen himself."
"Inverting the Pyramid ",The History of Football Tactics,Johnathan Wilson,2022/10/01,"September 27, 2022","Detailed, but a bit dry and seemed to run out of steam, once some major innovations had been dealt with. Did make me think that one setup seems to inveitably blend into the next."
The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read (and Your Children Will be Glad That You Did),,Phillipa Perry,2022/09/26,"September 14, 2022",Engagingly written with things to  try.
Managing archives,"Foundations, principles and practice",Caroline Williams,2022/09/05,"August 22, 2022",Work book - plenty to learn - will come back to it.
The Thursday Murder Club,,Richard Osman,2022/08/31,"August 29, 2022",Perfect relaxing beach book - which isn't damning with faint praise. Was charming and enjoyable.
The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum,,Heinrich BÃ¶ll,2022/08/14,"August 8, 2022","Really nicely written and tight little story. "
"God is not great ",,"Christopher Hitchens ",2022/08/02,"July 9, 2022","Strong start and compelling dismantling of religious thinking. Did ramble a bit, but worthwhile read. "
The Nowhere Men,,Michael Calvin,2022/07/17,"July 16, 2022","Good on a subculture that is largely unremarked on, yet crucial to a multi billion dollar industry."
"Arriving Today ",From Factory to Front Door -- Why Everything Has Changed About How and What We Buy,Christopher Mims,2022/06/26,"June 22, 2022",Really enjoyed the bits on the early part of the early supply chain - the containers and boats. The later parts of the chain were a bit depressing - a story of screwing workers to marginal gains - all to feed shareholders.
Naked,,David Sedaris,2022/06/22,"June 18, 2022",Funny and witty.
The Accidental,,Ali Smith,2022/06/03,"April 18, 2022",Lovely writing - interesting voices.
Prisoners of Geography,Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics,Tim Marshall,2022/04/27,"April 22, 2022",Did what lots of books tend to do for me - got me excited enough to bore people with the revelations.
Shooting History,A Personal Journey,Jon Snow,2022/04/18,"September 27, 2021","Bit slow going in parts, but refreshingly honest about his roots, career and a sense of unbelief at his luck."
Foundation and Earth,,"Isaac Asimov ",2022/03/31,"March 12, 2022",Loved the conclusion of the epic.
Me talk pretty one day,,David Sedaris,2022/03/26,"December 31, 2021","Resolved to get his after hearing him on Adam Buxton, and delivered in spades."
Foundation's Edge,,Isaac Asimov,2022/03/12,"February 12, 2022",
Second Foundation,,Isaac Asimov,2022/01/27,"January 16, 2022",
Foundation and Empire,,Isaac Asimov,2022/01/15,"January 9, 2022",
