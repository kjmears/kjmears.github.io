This was my beach book this year, and I'm glad "Di":http://www.diannmurphy.co.uk picked it for me. The book is themed through different stories, told by various plot devices. The first takes the form of letters from an 18th century passenger on a ship, followed by the journal of a Scallywag composer, followed by an investigative reporters thoughts, then an interview with a future servant clone and finally a shepherd in a apocalyptic future.

The range of the book is great with each chapters stylistic treatment working really well.

Couldn't wait to pick it up.

My favourite line - My favourite tantric sex position is the Plumber - you stay in all day, but nobody comes
