As detailed on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_university#Coat_of_arms) the coat of arms is as clear an example as you will find of an institution adopting a coat of arms to convey the history and traditional of it's previous incarnations.

Looking like a [Franklin Gothic](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/franklin-gothic/) the 'Newcastle' is loud and direct in contrast to the [New Century Schoolbook Roman](http://www.linotype.com/en/46730/NewCenturySchoolbookRoman-product.html) of 'University', which is traditional without being conservative.

The most jarring thing about this brand is the relative size of teh coat of arms - which unbalances everything, leaving the realtionship between all three elements unresolved.
