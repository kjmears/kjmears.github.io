What is it? - The shapes seems specific enough to be referring to something but I'm baffled what they could be. They look a little like leaves or pages curling, and it seems possible that the triangular arrangement is significant in some way.

As a mysterious, abstract mark the logo is very contained in the the square making it feel a little disassociated from the text underneath.

The angular little serif flourishes on the typeface I can't identify makes for a light touch that is sadly missing from the abstract mark.
