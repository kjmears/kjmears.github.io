Not the most glamorous title, but then the subject is fairly prosaic. Whilst mulling over what to draw next I was engaged in pushing some files up to a GIT repository. So I thought, that's a good a thing as any to draw, so I thought I'd base a drawing on some abstract concept of what it suggested to me.
