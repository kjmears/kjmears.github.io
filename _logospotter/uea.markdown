Set in a classical uppercase serif, the letters UEA are broken up in an almost stencil like way. The glint/spark completes the cross of the A creating an overall feel of a rather austere and technocratic feel. It reminded me of the NATO identity, and a quick search [suggested others](http://wikicompany.org/wiki/911:Occult_symbolism_III#4-pointed_star). The glint or spark from the logo is permitted to be used as a separate design element described thus

> It captures an iconic representation of the creative ‘spark’ or ‘glint’ which epitomises much of our work, whilst also communicating as a mark of excellence.

A method of integrating Faculty and Department names with the logo is also suggested:

> Logos with descriptors are made by adding either one, two or three lines of copy to the UEA logo. In order to establish a hierarchy for the descriptor Gotham Medium is always used for the first line, Gotham Book for the second and Gotham Book Italic for the third line.

The choice of [Gotham](http://typedia.com/explore/typeface/gotham/) is a good one; it's a very open and airy font with a confident modernity. When present perhaps the idea is to balance the sharpness of the main logo in this way.

### Summary

An interesting typographic exercise with negative space the sharp logo is a big contrast with the previous UEA logo, shown below, which evokes a late 60s futuristic vision and was distinctive in it's simplicity and boldness. Perhaps indicative of the university seeking a repositioning away from it's 60s roots, the new one strikes me as a touch on the delicate side in comparison.
