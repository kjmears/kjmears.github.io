For reasons unknown to even me, I was looking at the UCISA website whilst watching an interesting stream from the event held recently. Whilst browsing around the site I began to be curious about the organisation and started thinking about the structure of it; all the special interest groups and subsequent committees that Higher Education organizations seem to love. My curiosity coalesced around the question of how representative of the sector the organisation is.

I ended up learning all about the association and it's memberships

In my current enthusiasm for charts and spreadsheets I thought I crack my knuckles and see what I could glean.

The first step was to see if I could get list of all the UCISA members. Pretty straightforwardly available at [Members Directory][members], despite being unnecessarily in an html table, it's a simple copy and paste to get the member names. UCISA use their own system for referring to HE members, so their order ignores 'University' in the naming - I prefer to use more systematic [learning provider][provider] data.

Having got a list and organised it into a decent worksheet, I then needed to get the various grouping counted. UCISA has four types of membership
 - Full Members - 185
 - Corporate 133
 - Affiliate 13
 - Individual 4


There are lots of committees - 113 individuals, representing 66 different organizations.

Full members broken down by Country

Full Members broken down by region


committees broken down by country and region too.
