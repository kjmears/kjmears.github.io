End of my first term on the MA that I'm doing. I've been really enjoying the structure and opportunity to reflect in a more basic way in how I go about things.

Our first practical project has been to design a logo for an organisation and then progress that to a full corporate identity treatment. Taking the time to go through iterations of ideas and sketches was great, though it was tough to make choices about which logo I liked. That's where tutors and fellow students help. It's always fascinating to get someone else's opinion on something you've been into for a while. Often they see something completely different to you, and then you go off in that direction.

The other component of the course has been the critical design studies. Noel, the tutor has introduced us all to design discourses and their place in wider cultural ideas and theories. It's been very good to look at some of the writing about design and immerse oneself in the many aspects of design. Looking at designers whose work I'm unfamiliar or ignorant of and reading all about their attitudes and what work they produced gets me very fired up to learn more.

So I suppose that's a good return for the first term
