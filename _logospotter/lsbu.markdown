I recently looked at the [logo for London Met](londonmet.html) and that was some simple text, emphasising what most London universities do, the location, but it used a generic graphic mark to support the strong type. This effort from London South Bank decides to have just the type do the job of representing the institution. The modern slab serif is strong but a little undermined by the sans-serif 'University'.

With this approach there's not a lot to go wrong, and it avoids the possibility of a graphic going out of fashion, but I can't help wondering if more might have been better.
