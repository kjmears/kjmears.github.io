This is an early idea, which makes me smile when I say the name, which is a good start. The idea was to create a bio of a character to help me get an idea of the character and then the features that I need to draw.

Th process of creating a bio began with the name, which then obviously led on to the drawing you see.

I like the possibilities this gives me, and the similarilty to bagpipes.
