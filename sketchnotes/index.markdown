I've been drawing sketchnotes for a good few years and have been lucky enough to see lots of fascinating speakers. Taking notes in this way works well for me, and the people I share them with seem to find them useful too.

Below is a bug list of all the sketchnotes I've done over the years. I've sketchnoted the great [IWMW][iwmw] since 2012. Most of my sketchnotes have been done [live][live], which I've found the most useful for me, though sketchnoting from [videos][video] is also fun. 

An alternative to browsing the thumbnails is to take a look at the searchable list of [speakers][speakers]

You might like to read a little about how [I got started][blog] that I wrote for World Sketchnote Day - I've also managed to collect some of my thoughts about sketchnoting into a little ebook that is [available][book] for the price of a coffee!
