Worked up drawing directly onto the block. Enjoying drawing directly on to the block, with no Ctrl Z to help me out.

THinking that I buy enough blocks I can make some mistakes and be left with enough that I'm happy with.

As usual came out of my tutorial with a head full of ideas, which I now need to turn into action.
