The distinctive 'keyhole' negative space makes me think the typeface is [Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk Super](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-be/super/) and  such a bold choice is rewarded by some pleasing contrast of curves and straight lines with the three letters. Anchored on the baseline, the letterforms bleeding out makes for a versatile mark; lending itself for different colour options and image treatments that don't undermine the strong black block. The only puzzling thing for me is the floating building. I imagine it's there to provide another point of interest and seeking to create a sense of tradition and place, which it does competently, but is a little outshone by the type.

Special mention too for the excellent online documentation on how to implement the brand
