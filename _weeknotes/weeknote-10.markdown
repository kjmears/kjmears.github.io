Main events of last week were the [Port80](http://port80events.co.uk/event/port80-2014/) event and plenty of meetings kicking off what looks like being a fairly intensive period of work for us this summer.

I can't say too much about the latter at the moment, though I think it might be helpful to try to write here to keep the work I have to do on time and on track.

So, I'll talk about Port80 instead. The lineup of speakers that Joel put together was a great mix. I did my usual sketchnoting and the range is hopefully reflected there. The talk by [Denise](http://denisejacobs.com/) was a great set of ideas and tools to avoid self sabotage while [Matt](http://digitalbydefault.com/) entertained and horrifed us with a tale from the trenches.

[Dan](http://hereinthehive.com/) has obviously thought long and hard about content and making it truly responsive, rather than just sprinkling some media query fairy dust. I liked the way [Nathan](http://artequalswork.com/) explained how integral layout is to content, and showed how it has been considered throughout history.

[Louise](http://louisetierney.co.uk/) Gave us a timely reminder to work harder for our users, and dovetailing with that [Kimberley](http://kimberleytew.com/) gave an illuminating talk showing just how hard disabled users are sometimes made to work.

[Roy](http://roytomeij.com/) Introduced us to the dark arts of psychology and how we can use it, whilst [Kevin Evans](https://twitter.com/kwe) Talked about iBeacons, technology and the attendent cans of worms we open when using them - quoting the queen in the process.

I managed to speak to quite a few lovely and interesting people and I'd definitely encourage anyone who doesn't consider themselves to be a 'networking' type of person to just say hello - it really is that simple.
