Some [background](http://cheshire-heraldry.org.uk/unichester.html) to the coat of arms, which could do with some re-drawing to make the elements clearer and remove the inexplicable bevels which only serve to distract.

The choice of an inscriptional typeface isn't bad, but doesn't rescue the overdone shield - a shame, since with a more subtle drawing of the coat of arms I could see them working nicely together.
