## Updated

The [announcement][announcement] about the logo includes this nugget -

> the new look reflects the rapidly changing and highly competitive landscape of higher education and will enable Queenâ€™s to significantly raise its profile and reputation locally, nationally and globally to meet its ambitious vision.

I think that means, 'everyone else has a crest so I guess we need one too.'

As there as so many of these things it really boils down to how well implemnted they are. This one is pretty good - the symbols in the crest are decently drawn and interesting in themselves.

The wordmark is more interesting - seems like it's set in a tweaked [Brandon Text Black][brandon] which is a nice open serif with the sharp corners rounded off. That may or may not be your thing, but it is a bit different for a University, and once you've gone down the well trodden path of the crest, then different is good.


## Older Review

![Old Logo](/images/logospotter/qub-old.gif)

The branding guidelines say that there are two version - portrait and landscape, but there's no guidance which is the preferred option. There is a stipulation that the rather odd mongram pattern that fills in the Q should always be used, but at smaller sizes it seems to just fill in the Q in a rather messy fashion.

It's a shame since the Q itself is an interesting and engaging shape - made even more so in contrast to the ugly Q used in the sans serif type accompanying the logo.

I assume the sans serif is meant to offset the more 'traditional' feel suggested by the flowing Q, but along with the pattern it feels insipid and a little more oomph is needed for the type to hold up it's end of the bargain.
