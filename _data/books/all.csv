A Season with Verona,"Travels Around Italy in Search of Illusion, National Character and...Goals!",Tim Parks,30/10/2011,"A thoughtful book  that managed to marry up the visceral thrill of fanatically following this infuriating team with meditations on how it fits with the rest of people's live and society.""Great start with the chapter about the long away trip. Thought it got a bit bogged down with diversions about of a third of the way through, then ended strongly reflecting the drama of the season."

Stretch,The Unlikely Making of a Yoga Dude,Neal Pollack,18/02/2011,
The Case for Working with Your Hands,Or Why Office Work Is Bad for Us and Fixing Things Feels Good,Matthew Crawford,01/02/2011,
The Line of Beauty,,Alan Hollinghurst,01/01/2011,Very enjoyable. Loved the way it seemed to capture the mood of the period and the characters inhabiting the book seemed very natural. Wry humour contrasts with some poignant detail.
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Other Tales of Terror,,Robert Louis Stevenson,11/12/2010,
D-Day: The Battle for Normandy,,Antony Beevor,19/11/2010,
Writing Home,,Alan Bennett,17/10/2010,"The parts I enjoyed , I enjoyed very much. He is great at writing simply and directly whist simultaneously being lyrical and stylish in a low key self deprecating way. The parts that I struggled with were when he was describing world I know very little about, such as poetry, actors and plays. I still enjoyed the descriptions, but couldn't help feeling that some advance knowledge would have made it a little easier."
This is Craig Brown,,Craig Brown,15/10/2010,"The pieces about golf and the pedants society meeting were fantastic. After that the book settled into a routine of parodies, that were all enjoyable but didn't thrill me as much as the start."
How To Be a Graphic Designer Without Losing Your Soul,,Adrian Shaughnessy,07/10/2010,"Very good, detailed look at the nuts and bolts of being a graphic designer. Most interesting to me were the chapters on creativity and the mechanics of actually getting the work done. For such a practical book it was surprisingly good at rekindling large amounts of enthusiasm."
How to be Good,,Nick Hornby,21/08/2010,Enjoyable way to pass time at the rainy Greenman festival. Some funny bits and actually quite thought provoking.
Tickling The English,Notes on a Country and Its People From an Irish Funny Man On Tour,Dara O Briain,12/08/2010,
The Death of Marco Pantani,A Biography,Matt Rendell,08/08/2010,"Fascinating examination of the man as well as the rider. A fragile and mercurial character, who it seems came to embody the contradictions in pro cycling. Sad to read all about his unravelling. Sometimes a bit hard going with the vast range of characters and some complex doping terminology."
Industrial Buildings and Factories,,Oswald W. Grube,06/08/2010,Liked looking at the old black and white pics of some modernist inspired buildings
Bad Science,,Ben Goldacre,02/08/2010,"Was very good when it came out, and the science has simoultaneously got better and the understanding worse since it was written"
The White Tiger,,Aravind Adiga,17/07/2010,Directly written but with real subtlety. Almost an anti-hero. Found the way it described India's underbelly and the subtle relationships really good. Far more entertaining than that sentence makes it sound!
Cryptonomicon,,Neal Stephenson,24/05/2010,"Initially daunted by the sheer size of the book, but once it started it was a great read. Lots of nice techno phreaking, nicely counter pointed by WWII dash and espionage. Also a welcome relief were some genuinely funny episodes. Would have been a bit po-faced without that."
Ronin,,Frank Miller,15/05/2010,
What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,,Haruki Murakami,30/04/2010,"The title pretty much sums up the book. The style is very relaxed, simple and conversational but manages to be serious and thought provoking too. In relating what running means to him he comes to a wider understanding about himself  and in the process encourages the reader to do the same."""
Adventures on the High Teas,In Search of Middle England,Stuart Maconie,17/04/2010,"Enjoyable meander through lots of different, often forgotten, facets of the english character. Maconie clearly fell in love with much of the places he talks about and it was nice to see a generally positive picture painted."
The Virgin Suicides,,Jeffrey Eugenides,24/03/2010,"I was very impressed by this book, and unusually for a book I'm enjoying I wasn't in a rush to finish. It encourages you to take your time and savour the melachonic and wry way the story unfolds."
Fatherland,,Robert Harris,21/02/2010,"As is crucial with a detective novel, one has to warm to the the main protagonist and have lots of plot twists and turns. This book satisfies on both counts. The detective work isn't too brilliant to be implausable. "
How Proust Can Change Your Life,,Alain de Botton,16/02/2010,"The chapter headings act as good reminders for me and add the the general message I took from the book. To take time to enjoy things, to search for a true and authentic expression of one's thoughts and feelings. They might sound quite haughty ambitions, but the book made them very accessible and achievable by introducing a Proustian philosophy."
Slam,,Nick Hornby,31/01/2010,I thought Hornby carried off the tricky task of a teenage narrator pretty well. Rye humour throughout punctuated with very funny observations.
The Hell of it All,,Charlie Brooker,12/01/2010,"Usual great quality writing, virtuoso swearing,disturbing and entertaining rants, and underpinned by an obvious love of the best that screen based media can offer"
Tanaka Ikko,Graphic Master,G. Carlo Calza,07/01/2010,"Interesting work, but found the introductory biographical blurb a bit pretentious and fawning. Like the boldness of his flat , geometric work, and the calligraphic style of some of his other work. Apart from that I think the book suffers from the work being out of context."
Ignore Everybody,,Hugh Macleod,03/01/2010,Very quick read through - but am intending to re-read a few times. Love the pithy way that Hugh dispenses his wisdom. Think that this may well be a 'carry around' book.
Dunkirk,Fight to the Last Man,Hugh Sebag-Montefiore,02/01/2010,Sobering tales of bravery abound in this story of the evacuation of France in WWII. It seems the French were a pretty erratic partner and the British Army had to fight tooth and nail to extricate itself from the mess. 
Arthur and George,,Julian Barnes,02/12/2009,Very readable. Loved the dichotomy between the two very different main characters and the way the formal device of a chapter per character gradually eases and the story grows.
Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative,,Will Eisner,25/11/2009,"As you'd expect a very well told introduction to the hugely rich area of graphic storytelling.Clearly laid out in a way that helps to understand the fundamentals of telling stories - how  and ways to do it."""
Sam the Sudden,,Pelham G. Wodehouse,18/11/2009,"As expected, lovely phrasing throughout make this a very pleasant and enjoyable book to read. It fair rattles along with flourishes aplenty  and the usual farcical plot twists that could grate if they weren't handled with such verve and lightness of touch. You can probably tell I liked it."""
"Once More, with Feeling",,"Victoria Coren, Charlie Skelton",12/11/2009,"Charlie and Victoria set out to make a ethically sound porn film and this book details what they learnt about the industry, themselves and the people they encounter along the way."
White Teeth,,Zadie Smith,04/11/2009,"Liked the structure of the book. Just when the plot and cast was in danger of becoming claustrophobic, an additional set entered which re-energised the book.   I never saw the final twist coming but then I never do."""
The Language of Things,,Deyan Sudjic,22/10/2009,The Language of Things A fascinating book. The author whilst obviously deeply thoughtful and educated about the cultural significance of the objects that surround us he wears his knowledge lightly and makes it very easy to follow. 
The Sopranos,,Alan Warner,29/09/2009,"A book about the adventures and lives of a group of late teenage girls, out on a wild spree in the Scottish capital.   The story rattles alongbut the book is some much more than the hilarious language and scrapes the main group of characters get into. It's also about life in a small town"
Paper View,"The Best of the ""Sunday Times"" Television Columns",A. A. Gill,18/09/2009,"Just finished, and feel a little like I've had too many sweets. The format of columns of Gill's writing sucked me into the 'just one more' mode of reading, and though I enjoyed them all , I might have been better to  pace myself rather than wolf them all down."
Raw Spirit,In Search of the Perfect Dram,Iain M. Banks,06/09/2009,"Overall , though Iain Banks comes over as a likeable sort of fellow, with a nice life, the book was a little too rambling and repetitive for my taste. All the talk about great wee roads and driving got a bit boring  being told in the same way in the same style. It seemed that just as a theme was being developed he'd pick up another thread and follow that for a bit  then eventually (and randomly) return."
Filth,,Irvine Welsh,02/09/2009,"Found it pretty easy to get along with the Scottish dialect that the main character speaks in, though could imagine it'd a bit tough. Thought that the pace was a little slow at first but was then glad of the build up because the adventures of Bruce Robertson really started gathering some pace."
Blink,The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,01/09/2009,"Fascinating book. Amazing how powerful our subconscious is and all the things that it does when we interact with the world. I also really enjoyed the dedication of the people researching it. All related in user friendly stories  making the concepts easy to remember and relate."""
Previous Convictions,Assignments from Here and There,A. A. Gill,20/08/2009,"The second half of the book (writing from 'there') is very different from the first. Found they compliment each other well.The first is the angrier and more acerbic  and the second slightly more philosophical  though still entertaining. Highlights for me were the pieces on Golf  Exercise- which came under 'New York' and Capri."""
Knots and Crosses,,Ian Rankin,16/08/2009,"Thought it started a little slowly, but then as the characters developed the pace of the story picked up. Can see that there's plenty of mileage in the main character, John Rebus, and the character of the city that Rankin is developing. Don't usually read crime books, but found this had the desired effect of making you anxious to get to the denoument."
World War Z,An Oral History of the Zombie War,Max Brooks,12/08/2009,
The Uncommon Reader,,Alan Bennett,12/08/2009,"Very fortuitous coming across this book in the library. Wouldn't have looked for it, but fate meant It appealed to me at the time, and I'm glad it did. Read it in an evening  but throughly enjoyed the simple idea. Lovely meditation on books  reading and how it can change the way one sees the world.Told with humour and not a little insight."""
Robert Brownjohn,Sex and Typography,Emily King,07/08/2009,"Enjoyed the format where people who knew him gave their opinions and impressions of him. Found it gave a real impression of how creative, intelligent and wild a character he was. Also at a time where him and his contemporaries were almost creating a whole industry."
Quick Service,,Pelham G. Wodehouse,31/07/2009,
A Study in Scarlet,,Arthur Conan Doyle,24/07/2009,
Charlotte Gray,,Sebastian Faulks,24/07/2009,"Found the feeling of tender, urgent romance created by Faulks immensely enjoyable. The central character doesn't dominate the book - more of an ensemble piece where you find yourself caring about many of the characters. No easy happy endings  and illuminating on the complexities of wartime France. More complex and nuanced than the heroic resistance plot familiar in our history books."""
Visual Research,An Introduction to Research Methodologies in Graphic Design,"Ian Noble, Russell Bestley",21/07/2009,"Started well. I liked the initial setup of placing design in a critical context and seeking to discuss ways of going about research.Felt the book tailed off a bit after that. The case studies were ok  but mayeb a little self indulgent. Would've liked some examples of the research informing client set briefs rather than the designer as author stuff."""
The Fight,,Norman Mailer,10/07/2009,"I liked Mailer's irreverent and egotistical style. I felt he doesn't spare himself from his analysis, and his take on things was generally enlightening. I guess it was good to have him describe an event that I'm at least a little familiar with and provide some really good insights."""
The Corrections,,Jonathan Franzen,26/06/2009,"Laugh out loud moments with huge dollops of pathos and perception throughout. I was a little daunted by the size of the book  but the writing and the characters made me actually happy that they had time to unfold in front of me"""
"Axe-age, Wolf-age",A Selection from the Norse Myths,Kevin Crossley-Holland,07/05/2009,"Enjoyable myths and legends, that have always appealed to me. I decided I wanted something direct and simple to read, and got exactly that."
"Thor and Loki featured in lots of the stories - with Loki in particular being a source of trouble.""",,,,
Pragmatic Version Control Using Git,,Travis Swicegood,07/05/2009,
The Colour of Magic,"Discworld, Book 1",Terry Pratchett,30/03/2009,Read this since lots of people seem to like his books and I thought I'd see what all the fuss is about. Found it reasonably entertaining  though not as funny as I expected for some reason. Took a little while to get going  and was a little irritated by mechanism for getting out of one problem or situation is to whisk the characters away by a seeming rescue  which then turns out to have them in peril once more.
Watchmen,,Alan Moore,16/03/2009,"Loved the artwork, and the story kept me gripped. Liked the intertwining of the Black Frieghter story."
The Damned Utd,,David Peace,12/03/2009,"Great book. Rapid paced pageturner all about the fears, doubts, insecurities and machinations of a football manager. "
From Lascaux to Brooklyn,,Paul Rand,10/03/2009,
Play Pen,New Children's Book Illustration,Martin Salisbury,24/02/2009,"Plenty of good colour examples of illustrators work. Would've liked more about techniques.I particularly liked Marc Boutavant's work - reminded me of Richard Scarry.Sarah Fanelli continues to be quality. Lovely vivid woodcuts from Isabelle Vandenabeele"""
Hot Shots,,Kevin Meredith,23/02/2009,"I really like the brief and to the point format, encouraging one to get out and practice - a much better way of learning. I've resolved to try all the techniques in the book this year. "
The Mischievous Art of Jim Flora,,"Irwin Chusid, Jim Flora",22/02/2009,"Lovely work throughout, and by all accounts a very generous and warm man."
Then is Now,Sampling from the Past for Today's Graphics (A Handbook for Contemporary Design),Cheryl Dangel Cullen,10/02/2009,A flick throughable book good enough to have a glance at over lunch. 
Stalingrad,,Antony Beevor,08/02/2009,Impressive unfolding of the pivotal  battle for Stalingrad. I was struck by the enormous scale of the slaughter and the conceit of the politicians who necessitated
The Jeeves Omnibus No.1,,Pelham G. Wodehouse,25/01/2009,"Very easy reading, and delightful use of the language. Seems effortless, but really well crafted and enjoyable stories."
The Crying of Lot 49,,Thomas Pynchon,18/01/2009,"I have to say I am puzzled, and probably missing lots of the deeper postmodern criticisms that are constructed around the book.I found myself variously frustrated but delighted when I had managed to follow and enjoy the intricacies."
The Curiously Sinister Art of Jim Flora,,"Irwin Chusid, Barbara Economon",17/01/2009,
Renegade,The Lives and Tales of Mark E. Smith,Mark E. Smith,05/01/2009,"If you're after a conventional autobiography, the you'll be disappointed. But why would you expect Mark E Smith to deliver you one? The driving force behind the band The Fall  delivers bile and bonhomie in eual measure and I sat back and enjoyed the ride."
Money,A Suicide Note,Martin Amis,02/01/2009,I normally struggle with books that are full of sparkling language. They seem to intimidate me and make me slow down. In this case though I enjoyed slowing down and savouring the language and the various torments visited on the central character.
Berlin,"The Downfall, 1945",Antony Beevor,15/12/2008,"Absolutely incredible account of the final stages of the war on the Eastern front. I was particularly struck by the scale of everything the numbers of people killed  raped and imprisoned. The machinations of Stalin and his ruthlessness with all. The real horror of the end of the war really comes across	"
The Stars' Tennis Balls,,Stephen Fry,27/11/2008,"Pretty enjoyable. No killer twist, and took a little while to get going. Hated the cover."
Slaughterhouse 5,The Children's Crusade - A Duty-dance with Death,Kurt Vonnegut,17/11/2008,A curious and entertaining book. I like the way the story jumps around with little observations dotted throughout.
The Lovely Bones,,Alice Sebold,21/08/2008,"After the heartbreaking first chapter i thought i might struggle with this book. Well written but harrowing. The rest of the book then is a lovely infolding of lives and a surprising and satisfying end. Simply and directly written  but with real tenderness."""
30 Essential Typefaces for A Lifetime,,Joshua Berger,19/08/2008,
The House of Sleep,,Jonathan Coe,04/08/2008,"Enjoyed the multiple narratives of the characters, switching back and forth through time. Can see that this book sets the pattern for his later books."
Pies and Prejudice,In Search of the North,Stuart Maconie,20/07/2008,Funny and interesting about 'the North'. Liked the critique of the South centric view of England
The Wisdom of Crowds,"Why the Many are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economics, Society and Nations",James Surowiecki,14/07/2008,I enjoyed the book but ran out of steam a little during the later chapters about democracy and financial markets.
Snow Crash,,Neal Stephenson,28/06/2008,
The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,,Arthur Conan Doyle,20/05/2008,"First time reading any Holmes book, and very accessible. Will read some more"
All Played Out,,Pete Davies,05/05/2008,"Even after nearly 20 years I remember this tournament and it was great to see how it was from a perceptive and passionate writer who experienced it. Especially good on the Press  the Team and the Fans  who all have been maligned to various degrees."""
Jupiter's Travels,,Ted Simon,30/04/2008,"Enjoyed the way that Ted Simon didn't just relay the mechanics of travelling the globe, but revealed his thoughts about how the adventure was changing him."
Forever Amber,,Kathleen Winsor,10/03/2008,"The central character is breathtakingly selfish and grasping, such much so she becomes almost an anti-hero. My first go at this kind of genre  and I assume modern incarnations are even racier. There was enough of a story to keep me interested  but I think I've had my fill for a while."""
Race to Dakar,,Charley Boorman,30/01/2008,"Reasonably interesting, but a tad repetitive. Only so many ways to describe the impressive amount of endurance, technique and willpower needed to complete the race."
Penguin by Design,A Cover Story 1935-2005,Phil Baines,27/01/2008,"Great book, with lots of lovely pictures, illustrating the developments. mistakes and triumphs of penguin books."
How to be Free,,Tom Hodgkinson,26/01/2008,"Mostly enjoyed the encouraging and questioning tone of the book. It's big success for me is to tie strands together so that the connection between capatalism  society and the individual can be seen from a new perspective. The idea that one can find a better way to live a more contented and self sufficient life by questioning received ideas about lots of aspects of life. One small thing that grates is that the notion that life was always better in the past - I've a feeling that people have been saying that for hundreds of years  but I suppose it's better than postponing living for the sake of some better future. All in all if I had to explain the book to someone  I'd summarize by saying that you need to take responsibility for as much of your own happiness as possible and find the strength to go your own way."""
Dawn of the Dumb,,Charlie Brooker,13/01/2008,Dispatches from the Idiotic Frontline
The Rotters' Club,,Jonathan Coe,01/11/2007,
The closed circle,,Jonathan Coe,01/09/2007,
The Architecture of Happiness,,Alain de Botton,01/01/2007,
American Gods,,Neil Gaiman,01/01/2007,
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,,Mark Haddon,01/01/2007,
You Are Here,,Katharine Harmon,01/01/2006,
Status Anxiety,,Alain de Botton,09/09/2005,"My other holiday book, I thoroughly enjoyed this one too. Good for making you think about what you arte doing with your life and how status and the search for it is a powerful motivation for life.  He explains different philosophical approaches that have been taken through the ages and how societies' attitudes to status have changed.  Explained in a straighforward and accessible style, it's a book that can help you be happy."
Gulliver's Travels,,Jonathan Swift,01/01/2005,
Vernon God Little,,DBC Pierre,14/12/2004,"Really enjoyed this book, even though I read it in small chunks over a long period of time - Something I normally hate doing.  The world weary teenage wisecracking of the central character Vernon Gregory Little was great fun, though I sometimes found the first third of the book to be a little slow. Even a bit of a tease, with the momentous events in Matirio being revealed very slowly, and Vernon's role not becoming clear until very near the end.  Once the pace picks up the book is hard to put down, and indeed I was lucky that I couldn't sleep one night and had the opportunity to read the final chapters in one go."
Cat's Cradle,,Kurt Vonnegut,28/04/2004,Intriguing story where the writer learns of a substance that has the capacity to destroy life on earth (ice-nine). He tells his story and refers often to the invented religion of the book - Bokonon - a cycnical religion that seems both profound and absurd. I particularly liked a passage where man is refered to in a prayer as lucky mud.  Something along the lines of 'Lucky mud that was chosen over the other mud to get up and look around'  Also in there seem to be ideas about sciences power and responsibility for that power.
"Eats, Shoots and Leaves",The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation,Lynne Truss,23/01/2004,
