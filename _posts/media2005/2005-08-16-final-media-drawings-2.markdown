My take on "Derek Featherstione's":http://boxofchocolates.ca/ presentation. He talked a lot about testing, which conjured up images of strange looking machines.

I'm afraid Joe's likeness suffered by me choosing the a pen rather than pencil, him being far too dynamic for me, and me not being warmed up in my drawings.

By this time, I'd got a good seat in the middle of the auditorium. Quite pleased that I managed to get a decent likeness of "Ian":http://www.ian-lloyd.com/

"Molly":http://www.molly.com/ made this easier by having lots of hair to start from.
