At the bottom of a long drag of a hill that I tackled before work. It was far easier than I remembered it. Long, but a lot steeper in my mind. Once at the top there was a great fast bit, where I reached 50km/h and wasn't stopping to take pictures

The numbers for the ride:
Distance 31km
Time 1:21:01
Average speed 22.96 km/h
