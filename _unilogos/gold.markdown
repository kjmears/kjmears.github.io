As a brand with strong recognition and reputation in the arts and social sciences, a simple wordmark does the job without any fuss. In stark contrast to [Ravensbourne's](rave.html) wild experimentation this logo simply states the facts and is content to let the reputation cast it's spell unseen.

The logo has been incorporated in a new design system [discussed here](http://bpando.org/2015/10/23/branding-goldsmiths/)
