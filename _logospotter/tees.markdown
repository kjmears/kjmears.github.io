Nice to see a bit of [negative space][neg] being used, but it seems that the brutal simplicity of the approach in this case is being undermined by the logo as a window on a photo effect. It's liable to date pretty quickly, and it's a distraction. In this case the 'U' is supported by an unusual (for a University) 'futuristic' light sans serif that already looks temporary and cannon fodder for the rebrand consultants.

Overall, could have worked with the required boldness and confidence.
