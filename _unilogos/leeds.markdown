A representation of the landmark [Parkinson building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson_Building) establishing a sense of place. By directly referring to an iconic building Leeds are making a strong connection, and sets up a nice experience for any visitors where they can follow that visual from the logo to a real place.

Nicely balanced in the square and drawn with enough detail, it draws on a tradition of civic pride as well as suggesting the tradition and experience that one would expect from an established university. I couldn't see any examples of the logo in a portrait format, which may be the it's only limitation

The typeface for the text looks similar to Gill Sans, all in uppercase, and complimenting the period of the building. The are angular slashes from the top the T, F and the Es, perhaps echoing an inscriptional face.

Overall, an innovative way for a large established university to convey solidity and ambition with particular reference to the city.
