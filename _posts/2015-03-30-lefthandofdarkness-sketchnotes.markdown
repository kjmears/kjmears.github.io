Recently read 'The Left Hand of Darkness' by Ursula LeGuin, and frustrated with the amount of books I've read and enjoyed that have subsequently evaporated from my memory, I decided to sketchnote a summary of what I remembered immediately having finished convinced that it will 'fix' it more permanently.

I guess I need to check in six months time to see how much I remember.
