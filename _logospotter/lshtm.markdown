There's a comprehensive explanation of the logo, detailing the classical figures used, their meanings and the relevant to the University in the branding guideline PDF. Considering it was redrawn in the 90s it's not as clear as it could be, but it's illustrative strength still shines through. The uppercase serif has an [inscriptional](http://typedia.com/learn/article/inscriptional/) feel, and I like the way it's densely packed whilst managing not to have any odd emphasis of particular words.
