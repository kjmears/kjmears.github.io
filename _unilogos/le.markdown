[Coverage of the new logo](https://www2.le.ac.uk/institution/new-logo) - A change from the previous logo

the new one is a much clearer rendering of elements from the university shield with some standard uppercase serif. A nice touch is the coloured text, matching the colour in the shield, helping to make a safe choice work well by being executed well.
