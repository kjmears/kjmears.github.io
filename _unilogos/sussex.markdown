Nice typographic flourishes in this restrained effort from Sussex.

The main 'US' device is a combination of a lowercase 'u' and an 's' from a [Baskerville](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/new-baskerville/?utm_source=fontsquirrel.com&utm_medium=matcherator_link&utm_campaign=itcnewbaskerville) variant. The distinctive serifs and the joined 's' make for a flowing shape nicely terminated at the top by those serifs. I also like the little tail that's been added to the 'n'.

Fitting the understated typographic treatment, it manages to do it neatly and with some unobstrusive interest.
