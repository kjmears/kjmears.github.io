I love looking out of the window on the plane. I only wish that they were bigger. But then we wouldn't have had the cracking moment of "Goldfinger":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/ being sucked out of the window.

Taking Robbie for a poo on the plane was a pretty cramped experience. Wiping his bum whilst he was pressing, pulling and twisting all available control in the loo was pretty funny. Less funny when he decided about 30 mins laters that we'd have to do it all again.
