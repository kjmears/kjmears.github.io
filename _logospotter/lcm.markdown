Called a [Sound Signature](http://www.lcm.ac.uk/About-Us/Sound-Signature), I like that this weird, abstract shape has a provenance, but I'm not sure how practical it might be. The choice of a DIN (or similar) condensed is modern in a rather genric way, but does feel a little like an afterthought compared to the image.
