An description of the logo taken from the Branding Guidelines,

> Our logo is made up of two squares, like the two quadrangles of Founderâ€™s Building. It also features our coat of arms, combining the heritage of both Royal Holloway and Bedford colleges.

Is a plain explanation of a neatly put together device. The two squares contain and organise the elements of the logo nicely. The coat of arms is cleanly and simply done, and complimented by the uppercase [Corbel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbel_(typeface)). All put together with a vibrant orange that's unusual for a University. The white on orange means a little of the detail in the coat of arms is lost, but it still manages to fulfil it's role of signifying tradition.
