### Description

Similar to the previously reviewed [Aston University](aston.html) logo, this modern university firmly breaks with tradition and uses an abstract, dynamic shape to create a signature identity. Also, an echo of Aston, the Napier shape isn't just randomly picked out, but was originally abstracted from the N of the Napier. An arcane fact and certainly one wouldn't be aware of without the brand guidelines to reveal it.

Recently [rebranded to Edinburgh Napier University](http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/240k-for-Napiers-new-name.6183328.jp) from plain Napier University, the triangle is anchored by a gradient on it's bottom point, and is considered an integral part of the logo. This simple shadow brings some interesting tension to the logo.

### Typography

The guidelines tell us that Interstate is the chosen font. A modern choice with the angular slices from some ascenders and descenders perhaps a nice echo of the triangle. the large x-height and narrow characters of Interstate help minimise the space required by the logo with the recent addition of Edinburgh to the name.
