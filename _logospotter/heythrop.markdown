Using a [Rotis Semi Sans](https://www.linotype.com/164467/rotis-semi-serif-65-bold-product.html?showVariation=164468) the college is an interesting, if not entirely convincing variation on the crest/text pairing.

The shield itself is one of the more interesting examples, but the text choice tends to overshadow the graphic interest. In an interesting aside I found an interesting discussion on Rotis by some real [typographers](http://spiekermann.com/en/rotis/).
