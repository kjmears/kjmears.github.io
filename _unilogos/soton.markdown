Particularly interesting references in the guidelines about how the previous logo was compared to other similar universities, and found to be out of step. Which has led to the creation of a typographic logotype that speaks clearly and in a refined way, in line with where the university sees itself and it's competitors.

With such a long word setting it all in uppercase may have led to it being to shouty, so only the smaller portion of the wordmark is done this way. Using the [Freight family](http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_text) ,the main word is mildly compressed and the sharp serifs throughout the wordmark give a relaxed but distinguished feel.

A simple and restrained execution of a logo as part of wider considerations about brand positioning.
