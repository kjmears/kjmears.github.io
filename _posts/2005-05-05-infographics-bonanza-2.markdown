As always there is a smorgasbord of information graphics on all the channnelsâ€™ coverage of the general election. 

The early part of the election coverage is characterised by an army of correspondents, pundits, politicians and presenters filling airtime until the small number of significant results come in.

"ITV":http://www.itv.co.uk messed about with a strange snakes and ladders metaphor to explain the inequities of the first past the post electoral system.

Infographics are used in this early stage to explore all the possible permutations that can be inferred from meagre data. Usually comprising a presenter wandering around a computer generated set, and some flying 3D graphics.

The most famous of all is Peter Snow's "swingometer":http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/swingometer/html/labcon.stm now on the BBC's website.
