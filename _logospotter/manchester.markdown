A comprehensive [Brand Identity](http://www.brand.manchester.ac.uk/) site goes into a lot of useful detail on how to use the logo, the accompanying typography, and more.

As for the logo itself, I like the clever incorporation of the 'est 1824' within the word, and whilst not a subtle emphasis of it's pedigree it more innovative than the safe shield they could have gone for.

Also of note is the combination of purple and gold, a distinctive combination that stands in contrast to them more usual blues and reds that seem to dominate the sector.
