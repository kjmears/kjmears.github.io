excerpt: I was <a href="http://www.designmuseum.org/">there</a> at the exhibition
  about information design. It was my first trip to the Design Museum, and I had mixed
  feelings. It was smaller than I&#8217;d imagined, perhaps I&#8217;ve been spoilt
  by the scale of other museums, but was a reasonably acceptable building and interior.
  The shop was gratifyingly well stocked, espcially with current design mags and the
  coffee was good. I wasn&#8217;t suprised to see that minimal white was the overiding
  aesthetic, as seems always to be the case when someone wants to invoke the designer
  voodoo, but at least it was broken up a bit by some &#8216;digital baroque&#8217;
  illustrations.

I was "there":http://www.designmuseum.org/ at the exhibition about information design. It was my first trip to the Design Museum, and I had mixed feelings. It was smaller than I'd imagined, perhaps I've been spoilt by the scale of other museums, but was a reasonably acceptable building and interior. The shop was gratifyingly well stocked, espcially with current design mags and the coffee was good. I wasn't suprised to see that minimal white was the overiding aesthetic, as seems always to be the case when someone wants to invoke the designer voodoo, but at least it was broken up a bit by some 'digital baroque' illustrations.

The exhibition that I'd come to see provoked mixed feelings. The exhibits were mostly familiar as the same examples appear frequently in discussions about information graphics. "Minard's":http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters masterpiece is there along "Harry Beck's":http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1854141686/mearso-21/202-4842468-4891847 famous underground map. It was fascinating to see some of these things in the flesh. The "Isotype":http://www.fulltable.com/iso/is12.html work was especially fun, with one poster illustrating the respective risk of contracting TB amongst working groups such as bankers, farmers, waiters (who were at most risk!). The section that included various underground maps was good in showing the different problems of layouts around the world, and how New Yorkers didn't take to "Vignelli's":http://subway.com.ru/maps/1972.htm 1972 design. 

Having said that I then wanted an example of the info graphica that is currently doing that job. This is where I think the exhibition feel down. The sense of a theme to the different areas of the show was absent. I almost feel that the types of examples chosen and the range of activity covered meant that the show was too ambitious.
