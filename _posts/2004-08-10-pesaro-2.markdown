First impression on arriving in Venice was the spectacular and strange view from the airplane window of the lagoon that venice sits in. When we arrived on a warm day the sea was a terrific blue ad gradually the islands that we saw got bigger and bigger until we saw what I presume was the largest island. 

The first thing that struck me was the sheer amount of buildings. It seemed that there wasn't an inch of space left on the island.

Second thing that struck me was the road and rail link to the island from the airport. The umbilical connection seemed oddly futuristic.
