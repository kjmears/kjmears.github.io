The Long Race to Glory: How the British Came to Rule the Cycling World,Chris Sidwells,,22/01/2017,15:08:00,,,,"Not much more than a timeline through British Cycling history, namechecking loads of people along the way.

Moranthology,Caitlin Moran,,08/02/2017,22:33:00,,,,"Fun. In digestible chunks.

"The Hyperion Omnibus: Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion",Dan Simmons,,17/04/2017,14:00:00,,,,"Epic. Got into the characters, as their stories played out, though did find some if it all a bit impenetrable, but I think that tends to be par for the course with this kind of mammoth Sci-Fi. There was poetry too, which leaves me cold. Not enough to put me off.",0575076267,http://amzn.to/2pgLtFl,"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The Hyperion Omnibus: Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion",Search on Amazon
The Woman who Went to Bed for a Year,Sue Townsend,20/04/2017,24/04/2017,,,,,"Simply written and direct style makes it easy to read, but with a subtle cutting edge to the satire.

Hothouse,Brian Aldiss,18/06/2017,24/06/2017,08:00:00,,,,Loved the ideas throughout. Great descriptions of the future planet and creative imaginining about future lifeforms.
