Here is robbie loving the train journey from Venice to Pesaro. He loved the fact that the window opened wide enough for him to look out. 

Finally arrived in Pesaro about 23:00

We asked a young guy at the station how far it was to walk to the hotel and he was very friendly - going so far as to offer us a lift with his friend who coming to pick him up

From the hotel balcony we could see the evening passeggiata. There was a kids ride which was doing a roaring trade.
