The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,Philp K Dick,,2017-01-17,07:10:00,,,"As crazy as ever, and often tricky to follow the flips in and out of realities, but ultimately very inventive and enjoyable book.",0575074809,http://amzn.to/2kbQPzy,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,Search on Amazon
The Long Race to Glory: How the British Came to Rule the Cycling World,Chris Sidwells,,2017-01-22,15:08:00,,,"Not much more than a timeline through British Cycling history, namechecking loads of people along the way. Not a huge amount of analysis.",0233004041,http://amzn.to/2kALBMs,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The Long Race to Glory: How the British Came to Rule the Cycling World,Search on Amazon
Moranthology,Caitlin Moran,,2017-02-08,22:33:00,,,"Fun. In digestible chunks. I liked the more serious writing more than the amusing throwaway stuff, but that was good too.",091940885,http://amzn.to/2lsoIMD,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Moranthology,Search on Amazon
"The Hyperion Omnibus: Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion",Dan Simmons,,2017-04-17,14:00:00,,,"Epic. Got into the characters, as their stories played out, though did find some if it all a bit impenetrable, but I think that tends to be par for the course with this kind of mammoth Sci-Fi. There was poetry too, which leaves me cold. Not enough to put me off.",0575076267,http://amzn.to/2pgLtFl,"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The Hyperion Omnibus: Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion",Search on Amazon
The Woman who Went to Bed for a Year,Sue Townsend,2017-04-20,2017-04-24,,,,"Simply written and direct style makes it easy to read, but with a subtle cutting edge to the satire.

"Me: Moir, Vol. 1",Vic Reeves,2017-04-29,2017-05-27,,,,"I like Jim Moir(Vic Reeves) - the book was likeable, but not as manically funny as the man. Had it lovely absurd moments. Suspect Vol. 2 will be more fun.",014118955X,http://amzn.to/2tVDCeK,"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Me: Moir, Vol. 1",Search on Amazon
Hothouse,Brian Aldiss,2017-06-18,2017-06-24,08:00:00,,,Loved the ideas throughout. Great descriptions of the future planet and creative imaginining about future lifeforms.

Grayson Perry,Jacky Klein,2017-04-24,2017-07-01,,,,"Really enjoyed this. Been such a long time since I'd read a big art book with lots of colour plates. There are tons in this one, all with cracking descriptions and explainations of the process of creating the work and the ideas behind them. The themed structure was really good too. Brilliant value for so much good art.",0500290806,http://amzn.to/2wXX8JJ,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Grayson Perry,Search on Amazon

Non Stop,Brian Aldiss,2017-09-21,2017-08-17,,,,"Took a while to get going, but the second half picked up. Suberbly well thought out and explained setting and great how it all came together.
