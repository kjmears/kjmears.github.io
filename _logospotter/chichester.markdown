A softly spoken voice for a new university that doesn't seek allude to any bogus trappings of tradition, instead preferring to use a more abstract 'modern' device. The problem is that curved shapes chosen aren't very interesting or intriguing. The curves seem to echo the shapes present in the text, but never really rise above decoration. The typeface is pleasantly open and clean, looking like <a href="http://typedia.com/explore/typeface/optima/">Optima</a>, but in the arrangement and the rather insipid colours mean that overall the logo is crying out for a bit more.
