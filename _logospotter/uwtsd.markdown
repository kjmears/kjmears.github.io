Aside from the inconsistency of a obviously different version being used on the website, the challenge for this organisation is to display less than snappy name bi-lingually. The Gill Sans lookalike seems a pretty odd choice, especially when overpowered by the heavy lines above and below.

The shield itself is nice and simple, though perhaps could be a bit simpler to make the best of it.
