Business-like. No fancy shields, or serifs for this no nonsense approach. Reading the wikipedia entry makes it clear that it's one of the top business schools in the world, so has no need to polish it's reputation with any branding spin. The choice of such a direct approach, feels a a little utilitarian, but we're back to the benefits that a reputation confers beyond a visual brand.
