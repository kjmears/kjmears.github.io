It's an X for exeter. A conservative uppercase wordmark, with a pretty oddly expressive X. It's a bold calligraphic statement, I guess aiming to pull of the 'modern but traditional' feel that lots of Universities aim for, it's nicely done, but I still can't decide if it's really distracting or nicely integrated. I suppose the fact that I'm asking means it's the former, but not terribly so.
