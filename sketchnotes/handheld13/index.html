<p>Aside from the speakers there were other entertainments - </p>

<p>An electric guitar rendition of the Welsh national anthem,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/">Bruce Lawson</a> sang some of his funny web based songs - like a punk, web based, version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stilgoe">Richard Stilgoe</a>. - You don't get musically based web satire at many conferences. Also there was a 'letter to the web industry' from a couple of young kids, An acrobat(which I missed) and big finish of a Male voice choir.</p>

<p>Craig and Amy did a great job with such a mammoth undertaking and I think everyone enjoyed the day, (and probably lots of the night)</p>
