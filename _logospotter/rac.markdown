Combining a royal crest with the University name would seem like a simple, if safe choice, and the combination of gold and black lends some urgency, and almost a feel of a luxury brand - not sure if that's appropriate for an agricultural college - even a royal one. The curious part of this logo is the monogram in the bottom right, which seems like a relic of an earlier idea and looks like a loss of nerve. People usually like two for one offers, but not sure it works with logos. As monograms go, it's not bad but probably not strong enough to stand alone as a logo, so maybe it should be put out of it's misery.
