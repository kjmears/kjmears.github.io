Right here; right now: providing the information your students need and your regulator requires

The only talk that directly mentioned CMA, but as I mentioned earlier it's spectre was looming over the conference. I think that CMA is an opportunity for Universities to make some changes to content workflows that are sorely needed if my conversations with people about course information and all the issues around accuracy and clarity are to be addressed. Marieke managed to convey some of the issues but was also pretty frank in saying that no-one really knows how the CMA will pan out in the sector, until some of the complaints from students are tested.
