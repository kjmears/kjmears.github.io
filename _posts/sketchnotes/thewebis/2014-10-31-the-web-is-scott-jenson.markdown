Scott Jenson's talk was an intriguing introduction to some pretty technical aspects of the 'Internet of Things'. Scott gave out little hardware beacons to encourage people to vist [https://github.com/google/physical-web](https://github.com/google/physical-web) and get experimenting. Aside from that I also enjoyed his notion of 'Truck Ideas' and 'Road ideas' illustrated with the story of [Malcom Mclean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcom_McLean) - developer of the shipping container.
