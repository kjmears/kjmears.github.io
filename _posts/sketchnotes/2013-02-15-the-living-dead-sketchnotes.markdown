I've recently watched Adam Curtis' excellent documentary series 'The Living Dead', and thought I'd share the sketch notes I did at the time. It's an excellent series which I'd thoroughly recommend. You can find it at <a href="http://thoughtmaybe.com/the-living-dead/">Thoughtmaybe</a> as well as loads of others.
