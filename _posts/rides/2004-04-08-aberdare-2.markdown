The hard ridden for view from Aberdare. The climb was about 3km up, and the hardest bit was at the start. By the time I'd got to where I took the pics I was pretty tired, but what always surprises me about riding is how quickly you forget the pain.

No doubt the pros would sprint up that climb with barely a bead of sweat.

The descent down the other side was great fun, reaching 57 kmh (about 35mph). Even for someone as nervous as me on the descent.
