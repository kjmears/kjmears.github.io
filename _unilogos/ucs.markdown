## Updated

Very thorough [write up][brandnew]on [the Brand New Blog][bn]. Much better than the old logo, and the brand guidelines go to town to showcase the brand. Very much in the a new University mold, and refreshing to see one being bold and confident without trying to be too clever. More reflections from the [agency][case] involved

## Older Review

![Old UCS Logo](/images/unilogos/ucs-old.gif)

'Connecting' - is apparently a key concept - as outlined in the corporate guidelines. One can see the thinking of connecting the different sites that make up the university in an abstract enough way that makes for some visual interest. 'UCS' seems to be less cumbersome than 'University Campus Suffolk' hence the simple and bold treatment. I like that they have eschewed a grand concept in favour of a simple idea done simply.
