I'd heard of Digifest and met lots of people who've been, but this was my first. I was only able to do one day, so missed out on the long geeky conversations into the night that always happen at these things, which can often be the best part. On arrival I could see that it's a big event - certainly living up to the 'fest' part of the title. 

First session was the Keynote by [@JoysyJohn](joysy) from [Nesta](nesta) who rattled through a ton of very nice looking slides. It did feel a little like a longer keynote had been compressed and it's good that the [video](video) and [slides](slides) are available
