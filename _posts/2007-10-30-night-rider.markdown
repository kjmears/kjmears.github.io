On leaving the Heath hospital in Cardiff after visiting a friend, I had the dilemma of which route to take home. On my trusty Honda Dylan I have to weigh up whether I want the convenience of the faster and scarier A470 or the slower , but more interesting smaller roads.  I normally do a little stretch on the A470 where the limit is 50mph and then peel off before I get too much hassle from larger and faster vehicles.  Last night I decided to explore, not really being to sure that the A470 at night is best suited to being seen.

So I thought I'd go over the mountain, up Rhiwbina hill and then home. It was quite nerve-wracking going up the hill with the headlights on full beam, but with the contours of the country road making large shadows. Nevertheless it was my first time on a small road in the dark, and probably safer than in the day when cars come racing down that hill.

When  I reached the top of Caerphilly mountain I managed to take the wrong turn(like I always do there) and ended up in the town centre. Riding out of town, I again chose to go up over the mountain for home and this road was narrower and bumpier. It was still great fun to stop and see the great views of the lights stretching out across Pontypridd and the surroundings.

Bumping across the top of Eglywsilan reminscent of Steve McQueen at the end of the great escape - in my mind at least - I eventually came down the steepest bit of road I know into civilisation.

It was a great little adventure.

Almost as good as cycling up there.
