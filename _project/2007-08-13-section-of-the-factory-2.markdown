Section of the factory idea drawn on layout paper. Hence the very clear lines. I've drawn up a factory production line, and resolving to keep it simple.

I am realising I have a tendencey to get in too close too early, resulting in one area being overworked and others not considered and working well together. 

Hopefully, now I'm looking out for it I can avoid it.
