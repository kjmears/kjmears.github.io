Following a trip to "Hobbycraft":http://www.hobbycraft.co.uk in Newport we returned home with a model tank to build.

I've never made a tank model before and whilst glueing it, it occured to me what a strange thing it is to take moulded plastic pieces and glue them together to make a model when you could just as easliy buy it already completed.

Perhaps, it's related to the glue!
