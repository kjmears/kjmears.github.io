Some character sketches for the Scotland character. Over the past month or so, I've come to realise that the way forward that is exciting me the most is to create a character that is my own response to what I see as the defining rugby characteristics of the particular nation.

My thinking was getting bogged down in trying to give some kind of generic and balanced picture. I think this would lead to a bland and characterless illustration. The work needs to present not only my stylistic efforts, but i need to have the confidence to show my thoughts and opinions. 

I'd be happy if the enthusiasm and buzz I get when an illustration is excitiung me comes through in the final piece.

The Sketches here are on the right lines. The first things that come into my mind when I think of Scotland. Though I have left out alcohol - which I will have to address if I'm being honest about my resoponses.
