Covered in great detail (and with lots of comments) on the <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/im_with.php">Under Consideration website.</a> Where a link can be found to the interesting rationale behind the logo revamp.

<blockquote>Our logo is clean, simple and bold. It has been designed using our bespoke font, which gives our brand a unique and distinctive character. Our logo must always be reproduced from master artwork and never from a second copy. It should never be recreated.
</blockquote>

I think I agree with the commenters that say it's more of a campaign than an Identity - though I do like the variety that stems from this approach.

The bespoke font used is based on <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/neuzeit-grotesk/">Neuzeit Grotesk</a>
