I was looking forward to seeing Anna speak having enjoyed her [Pocket Guide on Style guides](http://maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/),as well her 24ways article [ on Jekyll](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/). - I wasn't disappointed - It was an intriguing journey through the weird and wonderful world of console capabilities and controllers. I found it a good wake up call to be better informed about the ways that people consume the things that we build.
