Seb Lee Delisle was a very entertaining and relaxed speaker who likes lasers. He also showcased some fantastic art experiments that were impressive on their own, but made more so by the knowledge of the technical skills and ideas that were involved in their creation.

I loved the [Moonlander](http://moonlander.seb.ly) work, and then like a true pro Seb, gave out some 'advices'. For me <q>Finish your Projects</q> was a good.
