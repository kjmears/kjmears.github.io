The Big Midweek,"Steve Hanley, Olivia Piekarski","Easy read, and revealing perspective that gives a bigger picture of The Fall. Nice to get a sense of how there were more talented people that came together and made it happen, and that MES needed them as much as they him. Reticent as he is to talk about himself you get some glimpses of self refelction, but mainly told deadpan and  all the better for it.",Life Inside The Fall
Periodic Tales,Hugh Aldersey-Williams,"Enjoyed it, but felt that it wasn't the best format - feltlike it could've been a series of distinct articles - found it hard to retain much by the end. Probably my fault for rushing.",The Curious Lives of the Elements
The Forensic Records Society,"Magnus Mills ","Lovely little allegory - clear enough even for me to get it, and nice details.Slightly ran out of steam.",
Angry White Pyjamas,Robert Twigger,Interesting journey and examination of his reasons for doing the training as well and interrogating others reasons. Nice pen portraits of all the people. Also interesting ideas of the Japanese culture.'torture disguised as celebration',A normal bloke becomes a deadly weapon
25 Years of VIZ,William Cook,"Writer was a bit too much of a fan, but interesting to see just how long they'd been at it before it got really big. Good variety of artwork and behind the scenes of the creation.",
"Madly,Deeply","Alan Rickman ","Took a while to understand that despite a seemingly endless succession of meals and names his obsession for the work came through, and he obviously really loved the work, and most of the things around it. Very much a shorthand style compared to the brief selection of angsty early diaries. Became more affecting has his mortality became more apparent, even though it wasn't mentioned. An insight to a type of self reflective diary - not necessarily one meant for publication.","The Alan Rickman Diaries "
Out,"Kirino ",Very much liked the characters and kept me interested all the way through.,
The Underground Railroad,Colston Whitehead,"Rattled through it  - characters grabbed me to pay attention to the horrors of slavery, beyond the 'yeah slavery is bad' to the specifics and then laid bare via the different situations and chapters. All very good.",
Grunt,Mary Roach,"Great fun. Really liked how she wrote it, Breezy and Informative, funny and curious.","The Curious Science of Humans at War "
Hellstrom's Hive,Frank Herbert,"Petered out slightly but enjoyed a bit of old school, sort of near future hard traditional SciFi",
The Female Man,Joanna Russ,Could only make sense of it by cribbing the wikipedia entry and wasn't worth the bother,
Put me back on my bike,William Fotheringham,Good on the context of the time ands eemed like e well rounding picture of the man.,
Marabou Stork Nightmares,Irvine Welsh,"Funny and strange start. As it went on you wondered where it was all going, kind of knowing that it wouldn't end well, but I wasn't quite prepared with the sharp turn to nasty and brutal. Felt like an authentic ending.",
"Dead Famous ",Greg Jenner,Caught myself and got bored of the topic.,
Pain,"Patrick Wall ",Started interesting and then got more wooly and unfocused. Became quite dull.,"The Science of Suffering "
Spoon Fed,Tim Spector,"One of those that could probably be a bit condensed - but interesting opinions about diet and nutrition, that we have to wait for the science to see how prescient they are.","Why Almost Everything We've Been Told About Is Wrong "
Just Enough Research,Erika Hall,Not really what I was after.,
"Black Box Thinking ",Matthew Syed,,
Going to Sea in a Sieve,Danny Baker,Fun - nicely written on how he ended up in and around music - especially froma working class background.,
Ring for Jeeves,Pelham G. Wodehouse,"Enjoyable as always but no Wooster does leave a little whole. This all came together in the end satisfactorily, but not with the usual panache.",
The Status Game,Will Storr,"Was keen to read this, as it's a fascinating subject. It's a useful lense to apply to how people behave. Great on the different types of status games, and how they happen in different proportions in a variety of situations.",On Human Life and How to Play It
Happy Now,Charlie Higson,Mental - took some turns and then some more.,
"Touching from a distance ",Deborah Curtis,Honest perspective of a figure often mythologised due to his early death.,"Ian Curtis and Joy Division "
Lost at Sea,Jon Ronson,Enjoyable variety.,The Jon Ronson Mysteries
A Nervous Breakdown,Anton Chekhov,,
A Visit from the Goon Squad,Jennifer Egan,"Wasn't sure how I'd get on with the shifting timelines and characters, sometimes hard to follow what's happening to who, but then it all seems to coalesce and the threads draw together. Especially liked the slide pages, which could have been gimmicky , but they worked and felt like an authentic voice. ",
"Bedsit Disco Queen ",Tracey Thorn,Starting a trend for me of reading musicians biogs - enjoy how they discover music and are often incredibly surprised by their own success.,How I Grew Up and Tried to be a Pop Star
King of the Ants,Charlie Higson,Pretty brutal.,
"Why We Sleep ",Matthew Walker,"Interesting things in it, but spoiled somewhat by him overreaching on some things and cherry picking others.",The New Science of Sleep and Dreams
"Psmith, Journalist",Pelham G. Wodehouse,"Either you think the prose is charmingly and cleverly witty and amusing or you don't I do. Does show it's a age a little with the occasional phrase or word that pulls one up short, but japes ensue with much mirth.",
Nutshell,Ian McEwen,"I imagine that the premise, whilst great, could've been handled badly and gone wrong. But it's really good. Lovely balance between ruminations and moving the plot along. Enjoyed.",
