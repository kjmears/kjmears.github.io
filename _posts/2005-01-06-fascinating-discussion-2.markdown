Fascinating Discussion on, what I think is a lovely "idea":http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00007Q&topic_id=1 

Would "we":http://www.glam.ac.uk  have the boldness to go for such a letter? Would we need to? I admire the panache with which they've tackled one of the earliest interactions a student has with their institution.

First Experience anyone?
