Been a while since I've done any work on my project on the Mac. This has been a conscious decision to try to keep the focus on ideas and not execution. But tonight, whilst walking home in the snow, I decided that some things are best done by creating simple shapes and then arranging them.

The Mac is a great environment to do this , and so I've begun with the image you see here.
