This felt similar to the Cardiff talk in explaining a real world problem they faced - A scary security situation caused by lots of sites - and how they are dealing with it. I almost felt they covered too much. There were tantalising things about how the Lean Startup book was influential, how they were rebuilding a live product  and the development setup to enable them to ship to product every 2 weeks.

I guess that was the beauty of this conference - anyone really into getting those answers could go and seek out the speaker and interrogate them - in the friendliest way possible.
