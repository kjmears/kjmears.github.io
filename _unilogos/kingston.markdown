Simple Helvetica in a square. Making the most of the London location in a similar way to <a href="imperial.html" title="Imperial College London">Imperial College</a>.

A <a href="http://www.accruebrandvalue.co.uk/modules/projects/article/20/the_kingston_university_story">Case Study on the Kingston brand</a> describes how the overall strategy is to 'tell the university's story' and as a consequence the logo seems to be a less important element in the overall approach. Overall not a great deal to like or dislike.
