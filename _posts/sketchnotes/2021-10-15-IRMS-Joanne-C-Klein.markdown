I haven't done sketchnotes for a while, not having any real world events to go to, and online can be tricky. The focus of being in an audience and having less distraction really helps me, so I was very glad to be able to attend a great session where I learnt loads. I have bookmarked so many of Joanne's links and posts, all with the intention of making the time to read/watch them, but this time I pencilled in some time to watch her live. It was a good decision - aside from the super clear slides and delivery Joanne answered lots of useful questions - one thing actually made easier by online.
