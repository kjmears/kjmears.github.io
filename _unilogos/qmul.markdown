Clever incorporation of 'Q' in the crown, which doesn't look forced. The two bits of sans-serif next to the crown aren't as clever, but more are condensed and functional. The 'University of London' text seems to be floating around a little leaving it unclear what the crown is attempting to align to. The whole balance seems a little off - it doesn't spoil things, but also doesn't do the nice crown justice.
