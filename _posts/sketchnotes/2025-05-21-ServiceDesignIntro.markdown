I took notes in my usual fashion over the course of three mornings doing the Introduction to Service Design course run by Jo Carter from [We Are Service works][We]. The course was thought provoking, informative and interactive, with a mix of great references, plenty of references to try out. Jo was especially good at handling some tricky questions that people had when trying to understand definitions and the thorny issues of applying the practice.

To go back to a great word I picked up from academia - all about the praxis.
