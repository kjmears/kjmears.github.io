A<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=logos+with+wings&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AsNuUvzuA4-o0AXcvIHADw&amp;ved=0CDAQsAQ&amp;biw=1276&amp;bih=739"> search of logos with wings</a> turns up a pretty wide variety, but not many universities. Apparently a Griffin wing, this treatment is angular and sanitised and along with the silver and blue gives it a feel of a generic corporate entity. I think the wing has been abstracted so much it doesn't really read convincingly as a wing.

The serif typeface chosen to ccompliment the graphic is a solid enough uppercase but doesn't support the graphic as much as fight against it. I think a <a href="http://typedia.com/learn/article/slab-serif/">slab serif</a> might have worked more sympathetically here.
