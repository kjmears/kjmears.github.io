Hello I'm Kevin Mears.

I've had a varied career at the same organization for over 30 years - this site is a place to post things and try things in the grand tradition of the early days of the web. Still a noble idea. I especially like to draw **[sketchnotes][sketch]** of talks, video, meeting, lectures amongst other things, and you can find lots of those on this site. You'll also sometimes see the results of me tweaking, testing and investigating on this site, in the grand tradition of sites as places to learn and try out ideas. You may enjoy, one of my more long standing projects - a collection and review of UK university logos, in the **[unilogos][logos]** section.

I've rekindled my love of films in the a big way in the last few years, and now **[log][films]** them, like a true nerd.
