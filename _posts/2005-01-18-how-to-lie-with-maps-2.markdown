I needed this information for my essay on Cartography and Design, but was drawn into the other chapters, by the frequent and interesting examples and uses of maps.

Written in a direct no nonsense style, the author stresses throughout the wariness that you need to have when using maps and helps you gain a deeper understanding of maps and how we use them.
