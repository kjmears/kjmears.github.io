Starting out with the lovely title, [The Institution For The Diffusion Of Useful Knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uclan), UCLAN have a very sparse logo

The name UCLAN seems at little cumbersome, but since [UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk) is taken I guess it makes sense.

A pretty figurative approach is taken on the rendering of the roses, instead of a the more abstract approach often taken by the newer universities. It's difficult to see past the red rose as a symbol to use when talking about Lancashire since it is so strongly associated with the county. Unsure why there are two. Whilst they sit tidily enough, the placement of the roses and foliage doesn't seem to add any great sense of tension or balance in the logo.

A little bit of [Pareidolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia) has the user vaguley aware of pair of eyes looking out. In fact the pair of red eyes put me in mind of an L S Lowry painting - [The Man with the Red Eyes](http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?q=the+man+with+the+red+eyes+lowry&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1389&amp;bih=1016&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=X2P_cgxkXxDyZM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,,-1060329418596,00.html&amp;docid=oG8cPIDdwED9zM&amp;imgurl=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/arts/2006/02/22/lowry003.jpg&amp;w=277&amp;h=350&amp;ei=nxivTsZEyISFB4PntOUP&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=181&amp;vpy=134&amp;dur=10383&amp;hovh=252&amp;hovw=200&amp;tx=123&amp;ty=152&amp;sig=106572362327578261119&amp;sqi=2&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=161&amp;tbnw=122&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=37&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0). I think this might be a bit of a reach , but an interesting association nevertheless.

The font looks similar to Frutiger. A legible choice, though used very plainly all in lowercase, giving it a strange, passive voice.
