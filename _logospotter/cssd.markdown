[A post about the identity](http://www.mattwilley.co.uk/Central-School-of-Speech-Drama-Identity)

Exuberance was required from the brief, and while that wouldn't be my first choice to describe this branding I do think it captures a certain showbiz energy. The custom font nods towards [those typefaces with lightbulbs in](http://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/freebies/free-pack-of-realistic-vintage-light-bulb-sign-letters) but with a more refined feel. It's a very open and airy wordmark, though as seems common with University of London affiliates, the addition of 'University of London' doesn't blend as well.
