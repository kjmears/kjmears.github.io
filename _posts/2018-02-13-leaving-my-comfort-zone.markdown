## How'd that happen?

I've recently participated in a [JISC funded project][labs] around developing data dashboards. Before I talk about my efforts I need to explain a little about the context. The two organisations supporting this activity are HESA

> the official agency for the collection, analysis and dissemination of quantitative information about higher education in the United Kingdom. 

and JISC

> Jisc (formerly the Joint Information Systems Committee) is a United Kingdom not-for-profit company[2] whose role is to support post-16 and higher education, and research, by providing relevant and useful advice, digital resources and network and technology services, while researching and developing new technologies and ways of working.

The two organisations work closely together on lots of things, one of those being something called HEIDI PLus (The Education sector is infested with Acronyms) which aims to make the data HESA collects available to members to provide Business Intelligence to the sector. As part of the continuing initiative to develop the HEIDI Plus service, Community Dashboards have been developed. These are meant to use the knowledge and skills of experts in the sector to build the products the sector needs. The programme to develop candidates dashboards is what I volunteered for. I can't quite remember how I found out about the labs - It's likely it was mentioned on twitter by one of the very engaged people who post interesting data visualisations. 

Anyhow I sent in an application and to my surprise was selected.  


## What did I learn

As you'd expect from a body serving the HE sector, there was a clear set of learning outcomes in the form of 'core compentencies' that I could expect to address with my partcipation. So in each of those compentencies I'll round up how I did.

### Agile Working

The way of working was described as Agile, but without any particular adherence to a particular framework. The team I was placed on had a Product Owner, and a Scrum Master, and we would work in a series of daily sprints to enable everyone to contribute whilst not taking them away from their respective posts. We used Basecamp and Trello for our projec management tools. Of all the competencies I felt this was one I was most experienced with, but even this had a few surprises. I've used basecamp a lot and am pretty comfortable with it - it's great for sharing files and then discussing them, but that didn't seem to happen much - Likely because people were restrciting their work on the sprint days (more on those later) and I guess wanted to get into the work rather than the meta tasks around the work. For the work on the sprint days we used Trello boards which were a bit new to me, and I wasn't as comfortable with them. Similarly to the Basecamp issue it felt that it wasn't really a core activity in the way that a team using a board every day to get the work done comes to rely on and invest in the maintenance of the board, the nature of the work and formulation of the team meant that it felt a bit like a chore to be done rather than a tool to facilitate it. The Scrum manager did their best to get updates and tasks organised in the most helpful way, but it felt like fighting against the tide of the way the team and sprints were setup.

In a more permanent team those tools would be crucial to maintain a useful structure and focus - with the limited time we had it felt like those things fell by the wayside in favour of the work getting done. The scrum master and product owner then had more work to coordinate things, but it ended up being pretty agile becuase the work got done.

### Visualising Data

Going in to the project this was the thing I was most looking forward to. I've been taking my own baby steps with PowerBI and Tableau, but was looking forward to getting to grips with some extensive data and working with people more experienced than me. Tableau is the platform of choice to create and dessiminate the dashboards and a remote environment was set up for controlled access to the data and as a place to work.
