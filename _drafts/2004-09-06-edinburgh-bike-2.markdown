On an expedition around Edinburgh, managed what "kwe":http://www.mpet45.co.uk couldn't , and saw the "Edinburgh Bicycle Cooperative":http://www.edinburgh-bicycle.co.uk/, and I saw that it was good.

Had a stroll up Princes St. and then up to "Calton Hill":http://www.scotland-flavour.co.uk/calton-hill.html where the weather was unseasonably wrm, with no Scottish midges, and a fantastic view.

Walking up the Royal Mile with Jo, Ani and Chris.

Had a meal in the "Filling Station":http://www.bestpubs.co.uk/layout0.asp?pub=143239. Called the filling station, and that's what it did for me.

Rest of the two days were taken up with the conference, and then a meal and a few drinks
