excerpt: My new glasses arrived today. I bought them from "Glasses Direct(Link to
  Glasses Direct)":http://ww.glassesdirect.co.uk after hearing about them a while
  ago on Radio 5. The founder of the site had just won a business award for the idea
  and the business. Apparently, he was needing some glasses whilst in college and
  was taken aback by the price from conventional opticians and came up with an alternative.

My new glasses arrived today. I bought them from "Glasses Direct(Link to Glasses Direct)":http://ww.glassesdirect.co.uk after hearing about them a while ago on Radio 5.

At just Â£15 I though that I'd give them a try since my current glasses are giving up the ghost. I tried the strange online app where you can 'try on' various styles but I've always found them to be a gimmick. The glasses came well within the 14 days specified. 

All I have to do now is get used to them. I though I'd go for a completely different style to the ones I currently have so am taking a little time to get used to them. "Dianne":http//www.diannemurphy.co.uk keeps going 'waheyhey!' a la "Eric Morecambe":http://www.morecambeandwise.co.uk/
