I recently attended the IWMW12 conference in the University of Edinburgh and had a great time. As usual the talks were interesting and varied but all based around the particular concerns of university web teams. 

During the conference I did my usual thing of drawing notes for the Sessions I went to, but I shared them as soon as I did them. This conference always does a great job of amplifying the event with great twitter conversations, streaming video, live blogging and the like, so other delegates picked up on them quickly and seemed to like them.

I've now made them all available on Flickr, and this is one that combines them all ( and adds a bit of colour).
