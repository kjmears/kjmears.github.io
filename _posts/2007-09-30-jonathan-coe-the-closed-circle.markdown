Very easy and enjoyable to read. The author has the charcaters use various forms and writing styles throughout the book to advance their own stories which intertwine throughout the book. I enjoyed the unfolding of the connections between the characters lives and their personalities had meet wanting happiness for them.

I rattled through this book pretty quickly, which is a good sign for me because it means I was drawn in.
