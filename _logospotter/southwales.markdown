The challenge of providing a bi-lingual logo can limit the options available, and this logo takes a pretty minimal approach.

The university name is more like body text than a heading. The red square is certainly bold, and has the curve adds some interest, but there's not a great deal to say beyond that. It's a solid implementation of pretty conservative idea, but perhaps lacking some ambition.
