booktitle,author,notes
"Will","Will Self","A literary retrospective account of his drug years, with glimpses into his background and path to who he is or was. Lots of reaching for the dictionary for obscure words - which I liked. Found it hard to follow at times, but the respect the effort to tell a tale of extremes in a way that matches."
"Snail, Where are you? and Moon Man","Tomi Ungerer","Two kids books I bought for myself - remembered how he came up a lot during art college. Nice Illustrations"
"Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austin","Once you can get used to the construction of the language, it was a very enjoyable crafting of characters."
"Skunk Works","Ben R Rich, Leo Janos","Skunk works came up in conversation, then popped up in charity shop so felt I had to obey the universe and buy it.Best bit was at the start. talking specifics on the development of the stealth fighter. Then wandered back and forth through different periods on the technical problems they solved along the way, building incredible aircraft."
"Everything I Know about Life I learned From Powerpoint","Russell Davies","Great. Have been recommending to as many people as I can."
"The Master and Margarita","Mikhail Bulgakov","Pretty funny, Satire? not sure of what sometimes. One of those that appear on 'best of' lists."
"Humankind","Rutger Bregman","Throughly enjoyed - one of these with lots of examples in support of a pretty nice idea. Does kind of follow he format of debunking things, that seems very common these days, and slightly dread a further debunking of the debunking, but It suits my optimistic outlook."
"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich","Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn","Strangely uplifting tale of survival in a the political camps of soviet Russia. Human scale story against inhuman context."
"Content Design","Sarah Winters, Rachel Edwards","Really useful - good to have around and refer to."
"The German Genius","Peter Watson","Abandoned trying to read it all at once - will dip back in at some point."
"Berserker","Adrian Edmondson","Enjoyed it more when he was talking about how he felt rather than things he’d done. Unfortunately there was more of latter as it went on."
"Robot","Adam Wiśniewski-Snerg","I kept going to the end hoping for a satisfying resolution of all the questions and mysteries raised in the early part of the book. There was a complicated and wordy philosophical discussion that was meantto deliver, but even then I found it hard going. Not without some merit. Had moments of entertainment, but took a long time to get to the dense, physics heavy explanations, and in the end had me wondering if it was all worth it."
"John Peel","John Peel, Sheila Ravenscroft","Enjoyed the bits he wrote more, and the book obviously changed a lot with the change of narrator. The childhood and formative years revealing a certain public school repression and perhaps the joyous search for new music was an antidote to that."
"Absolute Beginners","Colin MacInnes","Straight away was interesting because of the Nadsat like lingo, which perhaps influenced Anthony Burgess. Breathless and urgent throughout, and depressingly prescient with all it’s talk of immigration driven by Daily Mail chancers and racists."
"This is your Brain on Music","Daniel Levitin","Abandoned - Got quite boring quite quickly."
"Queen’s Full","Ellery Queen","Pleasant enough collection of detective puzzles. bit flowery writing in parts."
"The Elements of Content Strategy","Erin Kissane","Useful for when I was getting up to speed on Content Strategy - plenty of good stuff."
"Fingers Crossed","Miki Berenyi","Nicely written. Very direct. Honest opinions about herself and family, with a very unusual childhood the foundation for a career in music at a eventful time in British music. Especially liked her take on the britpop era - pretty scathing, and rightly so."
"Good Services","Lou Downe","Great book. One of the reasons I took such an inordinate time to read it was the amount of time i needed to stop and mull. Almost every page there is something to ponder on and relate to what you’re trying to do."
"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner","Alan Sillitoe","The headline story was the a strong opening, and straight away into a distinctive voice. It was a great inner monologue that gradually revealed more of the protagonist’s story, and then finished abruptly, but satisfyingly. The rest were variously bleak, sad, sometimes caustic, and occasionally funny. Sometimes all at once. I couldn’t face a 30 page poem to finish it all off."
"Moonraker","Ian Fleming","Obviously very keen on on cars, and breasts.Some interesting descriptions -  ‘the pointed hillocks of her breasts’ and ‘the impudent pride of the jutting breasts’. Alongside long interludes about manners, clothes and food. Eventually there’s some action, and it was all jolly good fun."
"Flash Boys","Michael Lewis","I expected that this would be great and it was. He has the knack of finding interesting, slightly nerdy topics and then goes further by hanging the story of even more interesting people that he finds. In this one, exposing how new tech enables age old dodgy practice by financial sharks, with the twist being that some of the people on Wall Street might actually do the right thing."
"The Bird of Night","Susan Hill","Taughtly written story about a relationship between Two men. one is  a poet and his friend describes his periodic descent into madness.. It seems to be  is a platonic love which makes it more interesting.I enjoyed the writing that created a suitably tense feeling of suspense."
"A Brief History of Time","Stephen Hawking","Well written, though as usual I let lots of the science wash over me. I’d struggle to explain much of it, but it was an enjoyable jog in difficult terrain"
"The Moon and Sixpence","W Somerset Maugham","Picked up on a little break away - randomness again. Nicely written."
"Tony Visconti","Tony Visconti","Interesting window into his work as a producer. Obviously very skilled and talented musician but can't quite let go of not being recognised enough for all the obvious skills he brings. Funny when he said 'all water under the bridge' when it clearly isn't"
"Underworld","Don DeLillo","Biggest novel I’ve read for ages, at a whooping 800+ pages. Most of the time it was enjoyable to read, I did describe it to someone as ‘muscular’ writing when I was half way through. I had had a few glasses of wine by then, but I think it’s a valid description."
"P.G.Wodehouse","Barry Day, Tony Ring","Curious book, a sort of half biography padded with morsels from sundry places, nothing with this much Wodehouse can be bad, but not great."
"Blankets","Craig Thompson","Really lovely figure drawing throughout."
"Sweat","Bill Hayes","An interesting quite personal journey into the history of exercise but ended up being more of a travelogue and vehicle for Bill Hayes the reflections on his relationship with exercise and what it’s meant for during his life."
"Stitches : a memoir","David Small","Not so keen on the drawings, but the story is pretty wild."
"Batman, the killing joke","Allan Moore, Brian Bolland","Great artwork, good story."
"Chernobyl","Matyáš Namai","Lovely scratchy 3 colour style of drawings"
"Flatland","Edwin A. Abbott","Curious little, apparently influential, early sci-fi. Fun"
"Mr Wilder & Me","Johnathan Coe","Nice and breezy."
"The End of Everything","Katie Mack","Enjoyable, and made the science as plain as possible - so I felt like I was understanding enough."
"Rogue Trooper","Gerry Finley-Day, Dave Gibbons, Cam Kennedy","Enjoyed the trip down memory lane"
"After Dark","Harakiri Murakami","I liked the short sentences, made it super easy to get into. Not quite so sure about the atmospheric mood creating that seems to be occurring. I  just feel ill equipped (or too lazy) to divine any deeper meanings. The best bits were the conversations between characters, where you get back stories, and a little bit of a plot that ends up unresolved."
"You Must get Them All","Steve Pringle","Read some, but all a bit too fan obsessive for my taste."
"Fancy Bear Goes Phishing","Scott J. Shapiro","An unexpected xmas gift. Having been ‘IT adjacent’ for many years I enjoyed this. Found the construction of ‘downcode’ and ‘upcode’ as a bit ponderous, Just felt odd to read. Probably could have done with out the last more speculative chapter."
"The Corner","David Simon, Ed Burns","Abandoned - Even though it started well and was well written, not sure if I could take 600 pages of drug tragedy."
