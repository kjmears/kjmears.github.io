Another drawing worked up from @media 2006. This time "Cameron Moll":http://www.cameronmoll.com is mobilized. 

All the talk of mobile devices and the combact green of Cameron's shirt suggested a kick ass military type Moll. 

About the presentation I was very interested in the challenges of designing for a different conext, and since I got back I've seen the mobile "device that I'd like to browse with":http://my.opera.com/organicchunkysalsa/blog/show.dml/309706#comments.

Like the previous efforts you can see my original drawing.
