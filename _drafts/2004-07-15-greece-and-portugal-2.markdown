Half of the men were killed on both sides.

One of the men said, It's gonna be a draw, so they stopped and looked and saw more danger.

So there was a huge battle between British, Irish and Greece and Portugal. On both sides they had machine guns, snipers, bazookas, powerful tanks, helicopters and cars.
