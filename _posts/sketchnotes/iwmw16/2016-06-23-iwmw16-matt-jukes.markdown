## When your website is a ‘national embarrassment’ the only way is up ##

I've seen Matt once before and it was equally smooth this time. One particular thing of interest this time was the fact that the ONS isn't part of GDS (Government Digital Service) but kind of affiliated with a similar outlook on the importance of user needs and development standards among other things. What is really gratifying is that all those standards and aims actually do translate into great products.
