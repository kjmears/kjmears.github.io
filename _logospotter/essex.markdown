Puzzling little abstract logo that I presume is meant to be an abstraction of an 'E'. The checkerboard pattern in two colours ends up looking like decorative edging rather than the focus that a logo should be. Allied to the very plain text the overall effect  is pretty bland. A bit more adventure in the choice of typeface might have paid off here.

An unfortunate association when viewing the on the web is that purple is the colour of a visited link, making it something that one registers as something to pay less attention to.
