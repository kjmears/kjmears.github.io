Enjoyed the process of taking one of my drawings and then adding some simple colour. Instead of using what has become the now traditional method of photoshop, I did some hands on colouring, taking me back to school days.

You have to go a long way to top the immediacy of drawing with pencil and then colouring-in. It's very different not having multiple undo for when you go over the lines!
