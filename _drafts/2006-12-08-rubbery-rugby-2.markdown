Some sketches for rubbery rugby figures. Perhaps I could combine them on a textured surface, with the previous amorphous shapes.

Think that they might lend themselves to a pattern rich treatment, playing with the scale and groupings.

Currently have no idea which team might be appropriate for this treatment.
