Sketchbook covering the period from Feb 2014 - July 2014. I was ready for an A4 sketchbook this time and picked a WHSmith sketchbook from my stocks - I agreed with [Sonia](http://www.whsmith.co.uk/products/whsmith-a4-sketch-pad-50-sheets/21241) on the comment thread. The paper changed and went from smooth to a rougher texture which wasn't as nice to draw on - especially with pen. The rougher texture encouraged me to do much more pencil drawing.
