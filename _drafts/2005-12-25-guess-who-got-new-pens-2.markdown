I thought I would try out my new Berol Fineliners. It's been such long time since I've used them and I can't believe that I'd forgotten how much fun coloring can be. I'd also forgotten how much one can change a drawing by bringing it into Photoshop and simply adjusting the levels. For example this drawing looks almost antique.
