Very simple and clear. Perhaps that's why there is a reasonably comprehensive 'Graphic Identity Toolkit' explaining the correct and incorrect uses of this plain wordmark. In fact the rationale is explained in the toolkit. In answer to the question 'Isn't the logo a bit boring?

<blockquote>The logo is part of our graphic identity system, and is intended as a 'stamp' of identity. A simple design was chosen to maximise legibility and recognition across all applications. The burden is placed on other elements (content, tone of voice, photography, etc.) to convey our personality.</blockquote>

Also interesting is that having London as an integral part of the wordmark draws on the huge brand recognition of London, making it less important to create one's own identity. The college being in London is a huge part if it's identity.
