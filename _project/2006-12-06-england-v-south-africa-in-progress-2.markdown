The first foray into Illustrator with this project. I've done some roughs, which I think has given me enough to go on an start in illustrator. In the past I've tried to get all the visual research I needed together before going to the Mac too early. 

I know that is good advice, but I've found I don't really know what kind of imagery I need to look for until I've started and got some ideas down.

Ironically, I think my visualisation skills are not great. I need to see things taking shape before I can react to them.

One key danger in this approach is being too wedded to staying on the Mac - As long as I can tear myself away when appropriate I should hopefully be ok.
