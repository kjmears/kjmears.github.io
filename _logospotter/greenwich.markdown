The use of an ornate rendering of a compass style pattern makes reference to the thing that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich">Grennwich (the place)</a> is most famous for - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmt">GMT</a>. Drawing on the local resource in this way lets the relatively modern university align itself with the ricjh history of the place.

The Typography is neatly executed upper case reminiscent of more established universities. The lower case 'of' provided a nice linkage with the ornate compass face, which makes the the text around the circumference pretty redundant.
