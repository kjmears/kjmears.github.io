I remember being irritated in school by people who claimed to hate school, and made a big song and dance about what a chore it was to learn things and have to put any effort into what they were doing. There was a general fear of being called a swot.

The calling usually being done by those too stupid to realise that learning something might actually benefit them. The cunning plan was to 'stick it to the man', by remaining ignorant and lazy.

I liked school. It was a chance for me to see my mates, and a chance to learn more about the subjects i enjoyed. I always felt that they were going through the motions - they'd somehow acquired the conventional wisdom that all children are supposed to hate school and rebel against 'the system'.

And anyway the people who were most likely to bang on about how they hated the work, despite all their protestations, always managed to hand in the homework, accompanied by the usual bluster, claiming that " I didn't really spend any time on it - I just did it at the last minute."

Mini revolutionaries, but forgivable in school age children where opinions are sprouting with the regularity of pubic hair and spots.


So what is the excuse for adults who do the same thing about their work?

When I  arrive back in my workplace, I can do without some pre packaged opinion that I'm expected to join along with and say that I hate my job and I'm worth so much more than people think, and if only I could have more holidays then I would be happy.

Maybe I am a swot after all.
