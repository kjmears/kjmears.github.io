Hello I'm Kevin Mears

I work as a web designer for the University of South Wales. 

One of my earliest memories is of doodling on waste punch cards from the days when computer programs ran on paper, I'm still amazed by technology and love drawing.

I especially like to draw sketchotes of talks, video, meeting, lectures amongst other things, and you can find lots of those on this site. 

I featured in the seminal Zen of CSS Design book and having been designing websites for over 15 years I'm gratified to find that it still excites and delights me.
