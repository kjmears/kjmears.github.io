I was looking forward to this talk put on by the Good people at the [Centre for Digital Public Services][cdps]. I've passed on Russell's wisdom on communication and more specifically slide presentations many times over the years, so it was a pleasure to see the man in action. I took a few notes, as prompts (a word now fast being claimed by the AI world) for myself. Using those notes to refresh my memory, I was particularly intrigued by Russell's point about how resilient and useful the Powerpoint format is turning out to be. So much knowledge around the world encapsulated in presentations - some of it useful. I liked Russell's idea of using powerpoint as a very visual repository, but warily circling around the idea as there'a a big danger I turn it into another procrastination tool.
