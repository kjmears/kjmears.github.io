A strong band of red with the [Stafford Knot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_knot) reversed out. I have to confess it reminded me of a pretzel, but as a decorative and slightly abstract shape to provide a focus for the logo it works well. It's good to see that the university has subtly made the most of this link to the location.

The typography is simple, strong, and by necessity for such a long name, tightly spaced. I particularly like the slightly lighter weight of 'university' and they the length of staffordshire has been turned into a virtue, and used to integrate with the red stripe. It anchors the whole thing well.
