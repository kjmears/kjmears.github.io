Interesting use of <a href="http://www.fontsmith.com/fonts/fs-clerkenwell.cfm?tab=detail">Clerkenwell Regular</a> - with a very curious extended serif of the descender of the lowercase p.

The wordmark reminds me of the Guardian identity with the different tints knocking back certain words, though it's a good solution to a problem of differentiation that many former polytechnics face. The location and name are grouped and University is emphasised.

I like the modern and solid feel of the typeface, and the intention seems to be to take a lot of care with how the logo is used, as evidenced by the extensive guidelines were there is a lot of guidance on how to implement the university's messages and tone of voice.
