Itâ€™s Time to Get Personal

I have to admit to being a personalisation skeptic, thinking that often people try to do clever personalisation without fully understanding the difficulty of doing it well. Maybe a bad personalised experience is much higher risk than a good generalised one? This talk did make me see more opportunities to do it well. I especially agreed with the sentiment that there needs to be more thought put into the transactions that make up navigating and interacting with our offerings and information. Also like the reminder to know the difference between vanity and useful metrics. Plenty of new ideas for steps into personalisation.
