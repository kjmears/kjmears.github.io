### Rebranding an old graphic

Durham University (the trading name of the University of Durham) Is the new brand created around the existing shield based crest. The existing shield has had a makeover to make it a bolder and more striking graphic.

### How they did it

Extensive use of the University purple and some negative space flattens the logo, unifying the elements from the original, with it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_(heraldry)">canton</a> upgraded to a full quarter in the newer graphic. The new version tightens up a few aspects:-

*   The Lions are simplified.
*   The chevron is linked to the cross where previously it was contained.
*   The inner part of the cross has softened corners.
*   and the exterior of the shield is also given a curve.

The softening of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_pattÃ©e">Cross Patee</a> may be a conscious decision to tone down what can be a symbol with slightly martial connotations, and that aspect works well. The strengthening of the cross by reversing it out of the shield is also successful, but I think the softening has gone a little too far with the overall shape of the shield - a sharper edge along the top might have provided more contrast.

### Typography

The branding switch from the University of Durham to Durham University, seems to have emboldened the University to emphasise it's location with a sharp use of Baskerville to provide a more refined and modern wordmark than the less modulated text used previously. The D of durham now has a curve tapering nicely into a strong ascender. The use of lower and upper case perhaps echoes the softening of the shield and speaks in quiet voice.

### Rich Graphic heritage

The collegiate structure of Durham University means there's a large degree of independence for the colleges, as can be seen by [this lovely page](http://www.dur.ac.uk/colleges/) showing the array of coats of arms of the colleges. With such a strong range of graphic devices that students and staff obviously are very attached to, then it must have been a daunting challenge to rebrand the overall look without losing that collegiate feel.

### Conclusion

A successful exercise in redrawing and moderninsing a long established emblem of the University, making it a more versatile mark to be used in a variety of ways.
