A green/blue on top a  blue background doesn't provide much contrast the graphic element of this logo, which is 3 mountains represented in a bold style reminiscent of the 70s in it's simplicity. Why they are cropped at the left and right I'm not sure. Perhaps the use of the mountains is seeking to create a sense of place, implying a rugged, rural setting? The treatment seems more appropriate for a range of hiking gear. Having said that, I think the bold style could perhaps have worked had the typography matched the graphic treatment and been more adventurous.

Instead, a stolid uppercase serif is used, lacking any flourishes or quirks it tends to add the to the impression of a logo caught between two stools. Lacking the hutzpah of a young institution or the gravitas of an older one.
