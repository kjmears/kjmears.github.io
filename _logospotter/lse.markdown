Clever approach to an unwieldy institution name, using the abbreviation that everyone uses, and the full text alongside. The use of a smaller red square suggests that the full text has been pulled out like a still from a motion graphic in a nice counterpoint of the larger square.

In the larger square there's a lovely balance of the curvy 's' sandwiched by the squarer letters. It all hangs together as a good solution to a tricky problem.
