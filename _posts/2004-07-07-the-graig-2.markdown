Well that's that out of the way for another summer.
Every year I ride up this hill at least once. I reckon it's about 1.5km from bottom to top and about 120m up.

This is the view back down from very near the top. Round the corner down the hill is the nasty steep bit , where I didn't want to stop and take a picture in case I couldn't get going again!

This is on the road on the way down. A nice fast reward for all the previous work.
