According to the [Press Release](http://www.rcm.ac.uk/about/news/all/newlookwebsite.aspx) the new logo was designed (for free) by [Landor](http://landor.com/). It has a certain luxury, elite feel though the arrangement of the badge makes it feel a touch regimental. It works better in the landscape version in use of the website.
