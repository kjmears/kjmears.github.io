Recently picked up this Isaac Asimov collection of four short stories, with this interesting sixties cover. I'm trying my technique of some post reading doodles to help my memory, and enjoyment. It was new to do short stories, and good to pause at the end to do a little drawing. I think I need to watch that I don't try to illustrate the story, but instead take bits that will act as signposts for me.
