## Managing Change: Leading Horses to Water ##

First talk from an external consultant and an interesting explanation that inviting them in isn't sowing the seeds of one's destruction, but turns out, they can help. Rob's round up of the different ways that Universities have engaged Precedent worked as a good reference for me. Having examples and case studies took some of the mystery out of getting consultants in for me, especially since that's not in my remit and can seem a bit if a mystery. In an event that lasted a week I might have found the time to seek out people from those teams to get more detail.
