Aside from the speakers there were other entertainments - An electric guitar rendition of the Welsh national anthem,[Bruce Lawson][bruce] sang some of his funny web based songs - like a punk, web based, version of [Richard Stilgoe][stilgoe]. - You don't get musically based web satire at many conferences. Also there was a 'letter to the web industry' from a couple of young kids, An acrobat(which I missed) and big finish of a Male voice choir.

Craig and Amy did a great job with such a mammoth undertaking and I think everyone enjoyed the day, (and probably lots of the night)
