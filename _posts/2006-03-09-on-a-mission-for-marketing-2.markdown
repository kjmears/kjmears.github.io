Latest dream. Haven't remembered one of my dreams for a while.

It started with me being called to one of the universities properties where I was given a mission to go and 'do some marketing'.

So off I went with a crack team, consisting of myself, Dr Ani Raiden fom the business school, and two other people who I know in the dream but can't remember.

We went off to a rough looking set of buildings. There was a concrete like row of shops all boarded up, and it was at this point that a yoof attempted to push me so I span round and threw him onto the floor. I then had to run into a lane that reminded me of a Viet-Cong like tunnel network. It had tall concrete sides and was surrounded by tall very green grass swaying in the wind.

I ran to the end of the lane and escaped by crouching down in the long grass whilst the ruffians ran past.
