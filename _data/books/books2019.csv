The Dispossessed ,Ursula Le Guin,2019-10-04,"As usual, Le Guin lets things unfold in a languid way, and I found it good that it made me take the time. I did sometimes feel that the ideas expressed were a bit beyond me, but then it came together more towards the end. Enjoyable - and perhaps a good book to discuss.",Fiction,http://amzn.to/2q8TwAs

The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths,Mariana Mazzucato,2019-12-27,"I rather whizzed through this, but I think I got the general gist - that the state needs to get a lot more credit for providing funding and strcutures for innovation that the private sector relies on. It's a good reposte to the idea that the private sector is always this dynamic powerful force and that the state is just a drag.",Non-Fiction,http://amzn.to/2q8TwAs
