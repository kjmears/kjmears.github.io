Owen's talk was a change of pace with an exploration of the way we write on the web with some observations about styles and their intent. I've done him a horrible disservice with my precis, so at least read [What screens want](http://frankchimero.com/talks/what-screens-want/transcript/) by Frank Chimero and watch [When we build](http://www.besquare.me/session/when-we-build/) by Wilson Miner.
