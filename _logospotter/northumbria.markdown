Newcastle has a bridge. Northumbria University (based in Newcastle) has a bridge-like swoop. I have no clue why the second line of uppercase text needs to be the size it is in relation to the all lowercase 'northumbria'. I guess its supposed to fit under the swoop shape, but it's just not interesting enough. Picking it out in blue doesn't improve it.

I get that there could be a nice nod to the bridge, but the implementation just doesn't seem up to the job.
