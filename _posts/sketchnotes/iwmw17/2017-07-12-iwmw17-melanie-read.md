### Making Digital Change Happen

Melanie's talk was quite a departure from St Andrews' since she explained how much restructure and change that the university has undergone, and that she has been tasked with sorting out a pretty big mess.

In such a a heavily federated organisation it's been crucial to have an audit and get a picture of the full scale of the mess. A digital strategy has been written and the important buy in from the top of the organisation has taken place.

IT looks now as a case of 'watch this space' to se how it all progresses. The talk was a good sense of perspective and had me mulling the fact that all the universities represented at the conference are on very different stages in the journeys to better ways of working.
