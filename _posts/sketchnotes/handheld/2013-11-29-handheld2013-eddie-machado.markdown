Eddie did an interesting roundup of the the techniques he used to create the handheld site. It was notable not only for a very in depth explanation of the process, but also for his honesty when confessing things that he'd done that he wasn't entirely happy with. Detailing the compromises in that way made it better for me, and talking about them in front of a huge audience must have been daunting.
