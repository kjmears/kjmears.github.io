After a few months of indecision I've finally gone and got myself a scooter! Ever since I was small I've preferred scooters over motorbikes, I think it's because there's something a little futuristic about the streamlining and concealed engine.

I was nervous at my CBT(Compulsory Basic Training), having never ridden a scooter before but the instructor was very good and after a morning my bike handling was good enough.

We then spent about 90 mins on the road at rush hour, but by the end I was really enjoying it.

Since then I've been out practising and am loving it.

How very continental.
