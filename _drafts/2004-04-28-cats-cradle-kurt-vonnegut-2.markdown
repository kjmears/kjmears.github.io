excerpt: Intriguing story where the writer learns of a substance that has the capacity
  to destroy life on earth (ice-nine). He tells his story and refers often to the
  invented religion of the book - Bokonon - a cynical religion that seems both profound
  and absurd. I particularly liked a passage where man is referred to in a prayer as
  lucky mud.

Something along the lines of 'Lucky mud that was chosen over the other mud to get up and look around'

Also in there seem to be ideas about sciences power and responsibility for that power.
