Chris Murphy's talk was a great way to start the conference, with some heartening stories of teaching the next generation. I particularly liked the reference to Industrical versus Agricultural models of education by [Sir Ken Robinson](https://www.thersa.org/discover/videos/rsa-animate/2010/10/rsa-animate---changing-paradigms), though when searching that, I also found an interesting [rebuttal](http://pragmaticreform.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/what-sir-ken-got-wrong/) to some of his ideas.

The RSA video has the advantage of being a brilliant delivery of the ideas, but the plain old blog post gets to the opposite view pretty succinctly. Whatever conclusion you draw you can thank Chris Murphy for helping us to think about some pretty fundamental things.
