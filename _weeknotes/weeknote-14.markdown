Been thinking a lot about some of the traditional deliverables produced by UX this week and how useful they might be on the project that I'm currently working on. I'm finding myself drawing more and more to work out what we want to happen with our content. I like this, but I'd like to pick the brains of some experienced UX people to talk about some of the pitfalls and approaches - there are some events I'm looking forward too soon, so hopefully that will be my opportunity.

After a good session with some of our content people I've a better understanding of their ideas, and made a start on them

Also did a little android icon work - which makes a good break from layout work, as well as another diagram of how one of our systems setups work - sounds dull to most people but I find it an interesting challenge - to try to capture relationships in a meaningful way.
