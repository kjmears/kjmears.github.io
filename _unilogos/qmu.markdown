 One of the institutions that's had a great name in the past - 'The Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy'. The shield reminds me of a rotary engine, (but I suspect that's just me) but it has a pleasingly simple motif of the crown. Not so sure about the rest of the detail which is a little hard to make out. Also hard to make out exactly is the serif of the wordmark, which has a tiny x-height. It makes for a very understated logo with a light touch.
