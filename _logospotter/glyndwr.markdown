From the 'does what it says on the tin' school of university branding. The university has chosen an all lower case rendition of it's name which at least uses the more flowing and interesting shapes of a lowercase g. The rest of the wordmark is pretty tightly squeezed - the Welsh and English for 'University' seem like a bit of an afterthought.
