Latest fun activity is the customisation of a mirror. Did whilst at the school fete. I think the kids enjoyed watching me pick up the felt pens as much as I did doing it. I'm finding that customising objects is a great kick start for drawings. In the same way that different drawing materials provoke a different response, drawing on things we don't usually draw on is very stimulating.
