This is the dream I had last night.

I am the Captain of a modern cargo boat. The crew consists of a handfull of men. Journey going ok until one of the crew for some reason has to go out into the ocean on a giant wheel to complete some maintenance task. 

A whale then comes up beneath the wheel and carries it away on it's back. Then another whale comes along and gets under our boat and capsizes it. The boat then hits the bottom and rights itself towards the light.

We then make it to port but the port is closed and we can't unload our cargo. I decide to go around the headland of the bay. The sea is rough and crashing on the long beach, which in turn is made of large pebbles, all the same size. I Walk for a while along the beach and show other captain (dressed in a napoleon  type hat) a place where I believe we can land.

By now my crew is bigger and consists of mainly children. The sky is dark and a brown light is diffused through the area.
I come to end of the beach and notice a wooden church. I look through the window and see a man attempting to commit suicide with shotgun.

I Ask why.

He shows me two people standing in front of a gate/portal to hell or similar.Suddenly I am back in what looks like the village in Dad's Army fighting zombies with rest of my crew.

I fight one who looks like Jimmy Carter.I fight dirty and kick him in the knackers, which winds him up. He then smiles spooky zombie smile and chases after me.

Then entered a church/library looking for a book to end this madness.

Dream ends.
