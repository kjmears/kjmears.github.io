The closing session of the conference.

## Static Site Generators â€“ Developing Websites in Low-resource Condition

In a sort of blast from the past when this conference was a little more technical there was a talk on static sites generators with particular focus on [Jekyll][jekyll]. I'm a long time convert of the greatness of static site generators and this very site is built with Jekyll. It's rather cool and we've been using it as a very nice way to archive sites. Paul talked about using [Hugo][hugo] for the [Dublin Core site][dub], and more people should get on board for such simple performance and secure ways to have websites - particularly good for reference sub-sites that don't change much - which universities have tons of.

## Developing Communities of Practice

Anna gave a talk about creating communities of practice and managed the rare feat of introducing a new acronym to a pretty acronym aware bunch. [VUCA][vuca] in case you're interested. It was a good talk but it did strike me that the IWMW conference is the culmination of a pretty comprehensive exercise in community building over many years, so some of the lessons would be familiar to many. I did get the sense that the talk may have encouraged a few to get starting with regional groups - time will tell.

## Ask Us Anything!

Glad that people cam eup with good question to prompt good answers. I was particularly encouraged by the demonstration that it's possible to have a virtual web team comprised of Marketing and IT that works well - they are other way to succeed than the single team.

## How to Turn a Web Strategy into Web Services

A tale of wrestling with the reality of a web estate after the formulation of s strategy. Put me in mind of something I once heard

> No plan survives contact with the enemy

_[Attributed to Helmuth von Moltke the Elder][wiki]_

Also liked the finishing reminder to aim big and be kind.
