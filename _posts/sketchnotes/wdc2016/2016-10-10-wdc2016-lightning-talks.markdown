Three very good talks about switching activities, making things and recruiting well.

Always enjoy [Jukesie's][jukes] talks and this was no exception, the importance of culture and creating good teams is a constant in lots of talk about digital transformation and it was great to have some hard won lessons spelt out (in a super clear [GDS][gds] style).

Also packed into were two great and different talks about creativity and making, which steered clear of any axe making cliches to emphasise the benefits of switching up mediums and techniques to stay fresh and explore ideas.
