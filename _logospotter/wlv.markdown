excerpt: Puzzling logo that is clear and simple whilst also managing to be timid and confused.

A two part logo with some neat and clear text on the right, accompanied by an unusual combination on the left. In the text the University location is stressed in a relaxed sans serif, and supplemented by three words which I would assume to a tag line. Unfortunate that the logo doesn't especially reinforce the tag line. It consists of a shape like a rosette ribbon. Perhaps alluding to a seal or certificate. Like the ribbon one might see attached to an official seal of some kind. Across this is place a squiggly w, reversed out of the white of the ribbon.

I find the w a little awkward - it's neither elegant or sweeping like calligraphy, or rough and vibrant like a textured handwritten w could be.

When one thinks of the [classic fun](http://www.paul-rand.com/) that can be had with one of the alphabets more jagged shapes, the w here adds little.
