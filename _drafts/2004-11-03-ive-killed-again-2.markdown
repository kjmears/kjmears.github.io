Someone stop me before I kill again. I've managed to kill another ipod stone dead. Though it seems that there may be "hope":http://www.ipoding.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=440&mode=thread&order=0 if I had some skill with a soldering iron.

This is the third one I've done "it":http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/cultofmac/index.blog?entry_id=489963 to. I'm going to throw the cable away. That seems to be the common element.
