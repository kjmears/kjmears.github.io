Read this for the Motion Graphic Design project I've just started on my course. Obviously quick and easy to read, but great fun. Dahl has a nice sick sense of humour that kids like, and adults can enjoy.

Also, the writing isn't patronising in any way. Simple but done with zest and care.

Quentin Blake's illustrations are great. In fact so appropriate, that it's hard to put them out of your mind when coming up with your own interpretation of the book.
