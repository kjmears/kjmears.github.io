<h1>Read in 2023</h1>

<p>These are the books I managed to finish this year. I got a bit more ruthless, and bailed on a few when I found them impenetrable, boring or just not what I expected. </p>

<p>
	The randomness of the charity shop has set me on a path of music related biographies and memoirs. I enjoyed the different approaches of the books I found, as they covered what it’s like to form a band, survive in one, what it’s like to be into music but not a musician, and  detailed some of the less obvious human costs of that way of life.
</p>
<p>
	Beyond the music biographies, I also read some thought-provoking non-fiction. The Status Game was one that I felt
	deserved its own notes, and Black Box Thinking was particularly interesting when it compared how aviation and
	healthcare approach mistakes. Plus, I managed to read a good variety of fiction throughout the year.
