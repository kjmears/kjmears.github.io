I always underestimate the time it takes to plan stuff, and probably underestimate the usefulness of it too.

I took some time to sort out a system of tasks that make sense for me, and whilst I'm trying to be wary of fetishizing the system, I found it useful to take some tips on Notion that helped me to clarify some things. 

I think I have a method that will work better now.

Thanks to that effort the rest of the week felt productive as I managed to allocate things per day and stayed focused on them. I’m prone to run off and get distracted by the latest puzzle to arrive in my lap, and this system with hopefully, help me to acknowledge it, plan it and then get back on track. Sounds like the kind of mindful talk that is all the rage at the moment – but it is good advice.

Starting to get my teeth in the deeper aspects of the job that will require more research and reading. Often that stuff can seem like less important than producing outputs, but since this is all knowledge work, you do have to keep filling the reservoir, and not feel somehow guilty when you do.
