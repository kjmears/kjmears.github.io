I don't need tech support, I need a priest. iPod number 5 has died. Is this a new record "Norris?":http://www.maybole.org/notables/norrismcwhirter.htm 

I feel like "Carrie":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074285/

To paraphrase ??If only he knew he had the power??

I think that my laptop's firewire port is the source of all my woes. I plugged the iPod in on Friday. (the same day that it arrived back from apple) the screen went black and then stuck on backlight with nothing else on the screen. I've tried all the usual procedures, (which I'm pretty familiar with now) to no avail.

Upon further "examination":http://www.hardmac.com/article.php?id=16 it seems that my TiBook could be a candidate for such a thing.

I felt sick to my stomach when it happened again.
