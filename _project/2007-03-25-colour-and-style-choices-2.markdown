The colour and style choices are harder than I first though they would be. I've traced my original sketch and now have developed some colours and textures.

I've made the Jocktopus a blue that is similar to the "saltire.":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Andrew

I need to to make the tentacles easier to see, by giving them some depth. Could do this with some line work or as I've started doing by using some gradient overlays. Some underlighting on the face to make it more monster-like would be a nice Idea.

Also considering what to do with the background. It's quite different from the original sketch, but the skyline idea gives me a more distinctive shape. Will do a Paris skyline to fit the France world cup theme.
