Lovely page of typography in the corporate guidelines explaining the usage and providence of the logo. Originally designed by pentagram and more recently updated by [Dalton Maag](http://www.daltonmaag.com/) the Mark is a refined treatment that lets the long established name shine through.

The K dominates and one can admire the understated elegance of the strokes because of they have been unafraid to leave space around the large letter. The rest of the wordmark is tighter with the italic 'college' providing some useful contrast.
