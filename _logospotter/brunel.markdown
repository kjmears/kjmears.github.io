## Updated

A trusty crest cleanly drawn, juxtaposed with some modish, 'contemporary' typeface - Complete with some pretty inelegantly squashed curves. I wonder how long before all UK universities eventually end up with a crest as a logo?

Some curious red separators in use looking like a perspective visual illusion - they look odd, but they do actually work.

An improvment on the overly plain previous logo, and on safe ground, conforming to many people's idea of what a University logo should look like.

### Straightforward and simple

'Brunel' is rendered in [Sentence Case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_case) with 'University' and 'West London' in uppercase and justified. There's been no tweaking of any elements of the fonts making this probably the plainest logo that I've yet seen for a University. The choice of [Futura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)) is obviously meant to evoke a modern and approachable feel and the lack of either an abstract device or the more traditional coat of arms results in a very direct focus on the three pieces of information.

The spartan nature of this modernist logo was a surprise at first, and whilst it's simplicity has grown on me, I find it too neutral
