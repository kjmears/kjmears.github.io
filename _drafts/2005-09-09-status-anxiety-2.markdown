My other holiday book, I thoroughly enjoyed this one too. Good for making you think about what you arte doing with your life and how status and the search for it is a powerful motivation for life.

He explains different philosophical approaches that have been taken through the ages and how societies' attitudes to status have changed.

Explained in a straighforward and accessible style, it's a book that can help you be happy.
