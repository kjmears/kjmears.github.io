Sketchnotes from an excellent session with Simon Lancaster, who came all the way to <abbr title="University of South Wales">USW</abbr>from <abbr title="University of East Anglia">UEA</abbr> - the home of the wonderful [Denys Lasdun Building](lasdun).

Obviously a passionate teacher and chemist Simon evangelised the engagement of Social Media to improve teaching and engagement. Lovely examples, enthusiasm and ideas.
