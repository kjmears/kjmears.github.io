Similar to the <a href="surrey.html" title="University of Surrey">University of Surrey</a>, the colour scheme and very wide open font combine to create a bit of a 70s modernist feel. I can imagine it fixed on a brutalist campus building.


Awarded University status in 1992, the University has used the trusty combination of a modern sans-serif combined with a nicely simplified crest. The typeface looks like a Univers - Futura combination, all kicked off with a very pointed 'A'.
