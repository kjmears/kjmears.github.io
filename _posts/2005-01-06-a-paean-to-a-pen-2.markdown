A short piece in praise of my pen of choice. I've tried many different pens, but keep coming back to the trusty pilot hitecpoint v5.

Apparently it "writes up to 200 metres":http://www.pilotpen.co.uk/products/index.php?size=&search=Liquid%20Ink%20Pens according to the very nice Pilot Uk website. 

I find the combination of ink flow, line width works for me on a regular basis. The "staedtler fineliner":http://www.staedtler.com/pigment_liner_gb.Staedtler?ActiveID=2273 , whilst an admirable pen, sufferes from the tip slanting away, which can be nice when you want that effect, but aggravating when you don't.

The thing that clinches it for the pilot is the versatility. Writing AND drawing, all from the same instrument. Truly, we are in the 21st century.
