### Students as Humans: Understanding and Segmenting the Real Student Experience

Interesting range over ways in which universities can understand Student behaviour better, by thinking a bit more about their experiences at university and what might be best for them as individuals, with some ideas how that might be achieved. [Bloom's sigma 2 problem] sounds mysterious, but looks interesting.

Building a fuller picture of the student should help to help them, which in turn helps the organisation.
