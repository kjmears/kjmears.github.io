Wow - I missed a week and didn't even notice.

Styles and more styles

Biggest change is working away from my desk and with our markeing team in their office where they've kindly made a space and have a nice big screen. We've talked for a while about trying it out, but it's taken some determined work on ther part to jump through the hopps to make it happen.

I'm not planning on working there all the time, but I have found it really useful to be on hand to discuss the work that I'm doing and get ideas about what they have in mind for different parts of the pages I'm designing. It's certainly better than independently working on things and then coming together, which can mean we've misunderstood each other and have to retrace out steps. It also means that marketing can be a little reassured by seeing progress happening instead of waiting for meetings, though we are doing daily standups now, and slowly getting better at those too.

As for the work itself it's still interesting though a bit intimidating how much we still have left to do. I'm still trying to update our pattern library as an ongoing design resource and as a reference point, though it can be hard then to think of a method for other developers to access the finished work.

This workflow stuff is tricky
