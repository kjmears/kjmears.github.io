In common with [Liverpool Hope](hope.html) Leeds Trinity use stars. That, and the name 'Trinity' are a clue to the University's religious training roots. That's about the extent of the references in the logo.

Next to the pleasantly proportioned and clear shield is a sans-serif that I can't identify, but looks like a condensed Gill Sans, that is kind of ok, but those squashed 'e's and joining of the t and y are little blemishes on an otherwise clean and simple logo.
