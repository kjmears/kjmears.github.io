For some reason I've taken it into my head to widen my musical knowledge in possibly the most masochistic way possible by having a go at [the 1001 albums to listen to before you die](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/kavikovi/1001-albums-you-must-hear-before-you-die-all-editions-combined/) challenge.

I'm a few weeks in now, and not surprisingly, have endured stuff that I have studiously avoided all these years. Some obviously not in my wheelhouse like Jazz, but also some 'classics' of various eras that for whatever reason never got a listen.

Predictably enough I'm tracking my progress on [Notion](https://mearso.notion.site/adfd9b279db4496ab2deee7851d44375?v=072477e65bbf4593aaac952898840f52), which probably deserves a post of it's own, and it's a nice way to track it all.
