Well, so many things and so little space in my head.

Managed to speak to <a href="http://www.molly.com">Molly</a> and thank her for my chapter in CSS Zen Garden book. Which my colleague, <a href="http://www.mpet45.co.uk">Kev Evans</a> managed to mention at almost every opportunity. I can see now where she gets the energy to write all those books!

Managed to rather embarass myself by asking "Joe Clark":http://www.joeclark.org a stupid question about captions/subtitles whilst drunk, I can only hope his pointed explanation of the difference between them the next day, wasn't just for my benefit. He also rather threw me by asking for a shoe phone - presumably not some kind of Bulgarian secret police gadget, but a slighty larger than usual feature laden phone.

Very pleased to speak to "Mark":http://www.markboulton.co.uk and "Simon":http://www.simonrooney.com from the BBC, and get into a discussion about typefaces. For Mark here's a "great short":http://www.cheshiredave.com/mastication/2002/07/0037a-btt.html film about one of his faves.

"Ed":http://www.ebcomley.co.uk played spot the "Threadless":http://www.threadless.com t-shirt with amongst others, "Jon":http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk 

Would've liked to talk more with "Denis":http://www.38one.com/ who must be delighted that his lovely logo looked great on the orange bags.

One particular pleasure was the drawings I did as a memory aid of each presentation. The best of these was this one of "Andy Budd":http://www.andybudd.co.uk
