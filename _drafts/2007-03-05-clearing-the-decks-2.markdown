After my tutorial last week, I'm clearer in my mind what I'm aiming to produce for the final show.

I've moved further away from the book idea and am convinced that I need to work on 6 or so characters. Gareth and John like the variety of styles that I work and think that'll work pretty well. 

Settling on one character per team, and to help me with this process, I think that a name and bio for each one will help me get a handle on what characteristics I want to draw.

Anxious to get one done and mostly finished, wary of spendng too much time in the ideas and non delivering phase. I can always work back to the ideas phase if need be.
