For Ling and Eddie's talks I was stuck in the dark seats and so my notes are sparse. Ling made some interesting points about the important of the big buying decisions that people make on her site, and doubted whether a smartphone could ever be a comfortable place for that kind of transaction. I suspect many in the audience disagreed with that, but you'd have to be pretty grumpy not to like Ling's presentation and gusto. Which is reflected on the site <a href="http://www.lingscars.com/">Lings cars</a>
