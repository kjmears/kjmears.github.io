No fannying about with too much recap from the previous effort, save the lame fifties- steampunk hybrid that thy lifted from Brazil without acknowledging that is was meant to be funny - or at least humorous.

Back to the action - The knife fight was ludicrous and funny and I thought it was going to have a Crank vibe of daft action, superbly choreographed with occasional wit. Keanu can manage that, I thought, and the kicking horses was a nice step up.

It jogged along nicely after that, but surprisingly went to shit when the Casablanca set piece morphed the whole thing into a level from a mediocre video game. And the whole level was designed so a dog had a ramp to run up and bite some bollocks - and idea not without some joi de vivre, but all fell flat from there on.

All the plot shite about the High Table was just the kind of lame shit that passes in a game cut scene, but not here.

Kind of perked up a bit towards the end, but was glad it was all over by the end.

And what is it with Keanu Reeves' run - does he really run like he's shit himself? Or was that a character decision - bold one if it was.

Having recently watched Trumbo - it was intriguing to see his screenwriting in action - an boy was it good.

There was a palpable melancholy for a passing age of freedom and discovery of the West with literally the juggernauts of development and consumerism. It was clear from the off, with great opening scene of a jet plane overhead while the cowboy wakes up. The theme followed through with the hubris of the helicopter pilot.

Real tension in the scenes scrabbling up the mountain and the elation I felt at the outcome was pretty quickly brought down the earth with the final payoff - which itself had a great little twist.

Warrior,10/01/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/warrior/,Film4,"Prior to watching this I had a conversation where we talked about how my letterbox ratings for films are all over the place, and then m’colleague shared his method with me; I liked it. Here it is. Every film starts with 2.5 stars, and its can either go up or down from there.  Take stars off for things, put them back on…. So I reckon I’ll give that a try.

It might even make writing more about films easier. Let’s try it for this.

2.5

First 40 minutes of sketching out the characters and establishing the backstories. So far, pretty perfunctory, though Nick Nolte is great at a certain agonised self-pity. Lost half a star for it all taking so long, and not making it’s mind up whether this is family drama with some UFC or some UFC with feels.

2

Here it is, strangely conforting in a sport film -the montage. This one is pretty bad. Also, wouldn’t moving to a smaller house be easier? And I think Jennifer Morrison could do more than she’s being asked here. 

Eventually we get to the actual fight scenes, where the fillers are dispatched as expected. The fight scene from Rocky IV turned up, Joel Egerton realised that he really liked that house. ‘Get outta there’ probably isn’t the most technical advice from a trainer, but seems to crop up a lot.

1.5

Reading this back it seems like I’m a bit down on this. The actors who had actual characters to play did a decent job and made the whole thing ok. Fight scenes were ok considering that whether you’re a MMA or Boxing fan or not, there’s more to those sports than the biggest, punchiest one wins - which is hard to capture. I think I’ll award an extra half star for  Kevin Dunn; cheesy as hell character, but carried off with some aplomb.

It all rattled on in jolly fashion, and picked up with his great sidekicks - especially Sandahl Bergman who looked great and was I imagine a pretty stand out strong female lead for the time.

The pacing seemed very up and down though - and the music veered from great to awful in the same way and some fascinating scenes like the demons fighting over Conan where balanced by a lame one where Big Hammer guy smashed up the giant snake shaft and bonked his buddy on the head?

This disquiet wasn’t helped by a dodgy cockney accent being the voice of the main protagonist. Throw in the choice of an Irish accent for the French postmaster, and it was all very distracting.

Yojimbo,20/01/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/yojimbo/,DVD,"I couldn’t decide what to pick from my watchlist tonight, so let the dice choose, and boy did they deliver. The opening music was so jazzy and groovy, and completely unexpected that it made me take notice, and never let me down.

Throughout the music was great - so varied and like an extra character. Mifune had such presence and just sauntered around the place, being vaguely amused and disgusted by almost everyone he meets. There were hearty doses of humour in the first half, but as he became less detached, and got involved it abruptly and wonderfully changed tone and became altogether more serious.

Mind, those Japanese do love a good guttural shout.",Animation,
Annihilation,25/01/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/annihilation/,Plex,"Pacing was really great - never dropped into that frantic action movie bang bang bang. 

I often enjoy these sort of mystical sci-fi things where a mysterious thing has happened and various theories are suggested throughout the film, but reassuringly it’s never spelled out for you, giving us plenty to chew on and talk about. 

Or you can do what I seem to often do and let it wash over me, and be fine with never totally, ‘grokking’ it (Extra sci-fi cred if you know who invented that word). The explanation from the physicist did the job for me. Engaging full brain power I guess you could see it as an allegory of climate change and a super nature, indifferent to human. Progressing without us - that’s a pretty easy one right?

All the actors did a great job, and nicely avoided overdoing the macho team, in peril being picked off - can’t help thinking that a male only team would’ve changed that dynamic. 

Only small gripe would be that if everything was evolving like mad then the insects would’ve been fucking massive and a huge pain in the arse.",SciFi,

Anomalisa,22/01/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/anomalisa/,DVD,"I guess the thing about a stop motion thing like is the fact it calls attention to the technique so much, but that isn't usually diverting enough to sustain interest throughout. I enjoyed the impressive style of this, and thought there was enough meat on the bones of the story to make it work.

Actors of the calibre of Jennifer Jason Leigh and David Thewlis really worked the hell out of it. I especially like Thewlis's rancorous snippets during the speak at the end - he really is the goto man for a top quality bile-filled diatribe. Which is making it all the more disconcerting to hear him currently doing Halfords ads.",Crime,
I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore,24/01/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/i-dont-feel-at-home-in-this-world-anymore/,Film4,"Thought it was great the way that it set you up to think this was going to be a movie where the odd couple gradually overcame adversity for all it to come together in the end, and it sorta did, but with a entertainer gruesome set piece. A slightly conventional end, but got there really nicely.

The big finale was creatively gory and bonkers, though not quite adjacent enough to force an entry into the <a href=""https://boxd.it/pUgA"" style=""background-color: rgb(24, 28, 32); -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">kitchen fights list</a>

Split,19/01/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/split-2016/,Film4,"To James McAvoy’s range of manic energy from ‘Filth’ and the cool sophistication of a young Charles Xavier, we can now add a speech impaired 9 year old. I doubt that’ll be used much. 

I’m not sure if I have a problem with James McAvoy. I thought he was good in this, and did a convincing job of the multiple character thing, though would it have killed them to throw in some more accents? Might have lightened the mood a bit.  I think his one or the other range might be my problem - perhaps I just need more of what he did in Trance. He still has a shot at redemption - if Ethan Hawke can get back in the red with me after the execrable ‘Before Sunrise’ then anything is possible. 

The whole jeopardy and attempt to escape was done well, and the most likeable character was the doctor. Wasn’t too bothered about the other two girls. The ending went south pretty rapidly, especially the messianic purity guff that just seemed out of place. 

And like so many modern films it had on a franchise friendly ending that rather assumes that you are curious enough to want to see more.

And gets to draw the psycho drawings in films? Is it one person who specialises in it, or someone different for every production - seems like a fun job at least.",Drama,

Morning Glory,02/02/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/morning-glory-2010/,Film4,"Feeling a bit under the weather so in the mood for something fairly undemanding. It delivered well enough on that front. Harrison Ford felt like he wasn’t really acting that much when doing his grumpy thing, and I guess we can be grateful that he didn’t need to be a romantic lead, cos I think he’s pretty ropey at that. 

Couple of times early on I came close to turning it off, but it got a pass because I couldn’t be arsed to find something else - there’s a quote for the poster. 

These things often feel formulaic, and there’s a certain logic in arguing that all films follow some kind of formula, and what we’re really talking about is execution. On that score, Rachel McAdams held it together though I liked her much better in meatier things like Spotlight and True Detective. Diane Keaton and Jeff Goldblum had enough to do, unlike Patrick Wilson’s character whose whole presence was pretty pointless. 

And I must be at a loose end because I’ve written much more about this than far better films.",Comedy,
The Professionals,03/02/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/the-professionals/,Film4,"Shooting horses - a western with shooting horses. Robert Ryan seemed to be in it mainly to look after the horses, and Burt Lancaster really didn’t give a shit about much at all.

It was a bit wearing by the end. 

On the plus side I did like the composition of loads of the shots, really looked nice. So, down to rest of it, it seemed a bit off with the jauntiness of the training versus the drama of the action could’ve done with a lot less preamble to get to the action . Though I did like the lieutenant hanging casually about while one of his soldiers gives a civilian a pasting with his blessing.",War,

Diabolique,22/02/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/diabolique-1955/,DVD,"Writing this review the day after because I was just too tired to write it last night.

This film felt long and yet I couldn't really say that it dawdled too much. Things seemed to take the time they needed for all the dynamics of the relationships to play out and the mechanics of the crime to happen, but it just felt LONG.

Simone Signoret was the dominating presence for me - a physically imposing woman, playing a powerful character.

The twist as it was, was reasonable but less interesting than the gradual disintegration and regret of Vera Clouzot's character.

Terror in a Texas Town,28/02/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/terror-in-a-texas-town/,Film4,"Not many harpoon versus revolver films out there, so that was fun.

The knock off Humphrey Bogart bad guy was sort of fun, in a 'I really can't be bothered with this anymore' way. Most of the character were pretty cookie cutter, and the script was pretty perfunctory. It all reminded me of a graphic novel, with some decent panels.

But then you'd miss the effect of the bonkers jazz/western fusion soundtrack. 

More misses than hits overall - and I really can't decide if Stirling Hayden's 'Swedish' accent is risible or just plain fun.",Western,

Good Kill,30/03/2019,https://letterboxd.com/mearso/film/good-kill/,Film4,"Very clunky expository dialogue throughout making for some laughably trite moments, delivered by for the most part, cardboard cutout characters.

Ethan Hawke calls in the heavy artillery of his best sucking a lemon expression to try to wring something out of the script. January Jones should've checked that someone had actually written here a part before signing up.

Bruce Greenwood was rather hamstrung by his script too - I just didn't believe that character would say those things.

It was a standard descent into crime for Frank Lovejoy's character, who never really held enough interest to be the centre of the film. Upstaged by Lloyd Bridges, in a charismatic but over the top turn

It all got really clunky with some class moralizing monologues - especially from the visiting Genius scientist - as literally the voice of reason, explaining to the remarkably malleable Newspaper men that they'd made a horrible mistake.

Jared Leto has an unfortunate level of immediate unlikeability for me, so that made it tricky for that character.

All fine - but did remind of my perennial problem with magic in films. Once you decide that it's a thing you then spend the rest of the film for franchise working out the rules. In the Harry Potter universe it's all well worked out so never gets annoying - in other films not so much.

All the sitting around in a ruined Hogwarts? why not just magic everything fixed, and save poor Tom Bell from sweeping up.

The opening scene reminded me of <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/nightcrawler/"">Nightcrawler</a>, with it's detached boredom, then quickly segued into a brilliantly shot motorcycle ride for the opening credits.

The first third maintained that cool with some languid pacing, looked gritty and great and slowly unfolded a story about upheaval, society and big ideas. It gathered a little more pace throughout and ended suitably ambiguously for a film about the mess of the sixties in America.

I've heard and seen it mentioned over the years and I've no doubt there are plenty of essays about it.

Coming to it armed with only my blunt critical tools, I found it very patchy.

I'm cool with fairly abstract soundscapes and visual compositions and this delivered plenty of those throughout. They were punctuated by lots of baffling scenes that I could guess a little bit about. 

I think that the title signposts that the Garden of Eden is the starting point and then there's plenty of religious imagery and what I can only guess are allegories. The problem being that things weren't arresting enough for me to really care. Maybe all those critical studies essays would enhance one's enjoyment, but I don't want to do homework.

There was just about enough for me to get something out of it, but also the lingering resentment of this type of stuff. I'm glad more challenging work is out there as I'm sure it's good that it exists, but I'm also glad that I don't have to watch it.
