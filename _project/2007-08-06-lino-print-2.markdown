Finally, with the expertise and time of my good lady wife Dianne, I have produced a lino print for the NZ illustration that I've been working on for some time.

This is a photo from my basic point and shoot camera, but it gives some idea. I'm happy with the 3 good prints that I have from the lino, with the option to do more in future.

I'll be really happy once the image is safe and sound in a nice frame.
