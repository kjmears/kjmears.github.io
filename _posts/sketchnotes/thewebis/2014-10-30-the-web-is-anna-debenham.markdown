I was looking forward to seeing Anna speak having enjoyed her [Pocket Guide](http://maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/) on Style guides, and her [guide to Jekyll](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/), that helped to kick start my use of it. I wasn't disappointed  - it was an intruiging journey through weird and wonderful world of console capabilities and controllers. I found it a good wake up call to be better informed about the ways that people consume the things that we build.
