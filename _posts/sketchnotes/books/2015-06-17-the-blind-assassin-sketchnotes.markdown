My post reading sketchnote from '[The Blind Assassin](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blind-Assassin-Margaret-Atwood/dp/1860498809/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434564789&sr=8-1&keywords=the+blind+assassin)' by Margaret Atwood. It took a while for me to get into it, but then it was really enjoyable. Some evocative passages and convincing backdrop to a well told story. The multiple narratives and switches never felt contrived.

As for my notes - I could do with more work on the particular look of the characters - but that really is for the proper illustrators and artists.
