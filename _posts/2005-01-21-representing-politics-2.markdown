My mind map of a very interesting lecture, that talked a lot about the Tories' 'Labour isn't working' poster of the 1979 General Election. I've already seen slogans for the upcoming election that refer back to this work. 

On the latest round of Labour's posters the slogan is ??Britain is working??.
