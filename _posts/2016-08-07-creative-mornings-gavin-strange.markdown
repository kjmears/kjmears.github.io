A cracking way to spend a Saturday morning. The lovely people at [Creative Mornings, Cardiff][cmcdf] put on another cracking speaker, and the Saturday Morning format was great for me, meaning I could hang around a little after. [Gavin Strange's][gavin] talk was a whirlwind journey through his work and some of the stories behind it. The joy he has creating such a varied range of cracking work really came across. I scribbled out just a few of the things that had particular resonance for me - not sure that anyone else would find them any use, but Gavin said to share, so I am.
