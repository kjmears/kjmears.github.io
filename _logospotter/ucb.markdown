Including the full crest in it's ornate finery is a mistake. It might look great on the side of a building, but needs simplifying to work as a logo. I'm puzzled by the choiceto overlay a Eurostyle like square sans-serif over what looks like Garamond. It all looks pretty thrown together, without any real idea of what they were trying to achieve. It looks like they decided that a University needs a crest, and some 'classic' type, then lost their nerve.
