> Folks ask me all the time if I draw during the talks or after. The answer is yes. The top panel shows what my my notes look like during the presentation. Later I go back and outline the words, give structure, fill holes. Then finally I ink the hell out of it.

Lovely example of sketchnote journalling. The structured questions are a great framework and relaxed introduction.
