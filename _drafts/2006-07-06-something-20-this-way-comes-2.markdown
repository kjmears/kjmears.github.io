Been very busy so this working up of more @media sketches took a little longer than anticipated.

I did this one during the WCAG panel, and there was much talk about the sheer size of the documentation and a discussion of the new guidlines.

I found it good to get a variety of views on the new guidlines and left the session feeling a little more optimistic about the guidelines. But still with a lot of reading ahead.
