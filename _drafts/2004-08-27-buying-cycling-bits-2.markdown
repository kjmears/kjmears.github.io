I like buying bits for my bikes. My favourite site is"Wiggle":http://www.wiggle.co.uk, where there are loads of essential and non-essential things cycling. It's funny how the list of must -have's seem always to expand with the products that are there.

I've bought some new clipless pedals, and am waiting for my Alivio Chainset that conforms to my rule of trying to uograde whenever something needs replacing on the bike.
