Type only modern logo with curious integration of the letters k and e. Looks to be set in [The Mix](http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/lucasfonts/themix_plain/) , part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis_(typeface)">Thesis</a> family by Lucas DeGroot. It is a mainly serif font but the wide serifs on the letters i, n and r add a little personality to what might otherwise be a neutral font.

Talking about personality, the rest of the wordmark is dominated by the curve added to the letter K that joins to the letter in e in a kind of smile, that has the e peeking out.

### Summary

A pretty informal feel is created by the little additions of personality to the words, and the fact that the e is obscured rather than joined to the tail of the K is a little offputting. Overall, a simple device for an organisation aiming for a fresh approach.
