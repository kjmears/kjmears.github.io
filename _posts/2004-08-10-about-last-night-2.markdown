Dreamt about "Ed's":http://www.ebcomley.co.uk wife last night! Ed, Kate, "KWE":http://www.mpet45.co.uk and myself were all cycling up a very steep dusty hill. KWE was in front (thus confriming the unreality of it all), Kate was next then myself pedalling really fast but actually getting slower as Ed overtook me.

On reaching the top we were all in a scrapyard. Kate opened up an oil barrel, which contained a rusting metal skeleton, all curled up.

And that was that.
