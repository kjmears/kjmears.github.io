Really useful day with experts from across the sector with practical advice and insight in getting to grips with the new Digital Accessibility regulations.

*Sketches of first talk*

A brief outline from Fiona about her path to here, touching on some very familiar issues to the room.

*Sketchnotes of Adil's talk*

Always great to get a talk from someone who actually uses accessibility tools, and enlightening. Adil was also a really engaging speaker, and daredevil.

Accessibility advice from the horses mouth *_not an actual horse_

*Sketchnotes of Ian Woolner's talk*

Ian showed some really handy Microsoft Accessibility tools that everyone was eager to get back and test. Also a key message is **Stay current with your software**

*Sketchnotes of Institutional Case Studies Talk*

The nitty gritty of what people are doing. Always impressed that people get up and are so honest, and I think everyone appreciates it. A little bit of group therapy goes a long way.

*Sketchnotes of Ben and George's Talk*

George blew me away with the depth of the work that he's done, how many connections and inititaive he's been involved with and the sheer commitment to trawl through so many public bodies when researching real world statements.

*Sketchnotes of Abi James' Talk*

Nice way to finish a day that could easily have been daunting and a downer, but left feeling that despite the massive amount of work still to do, there are so many good resources and people in the area, that it seems more achievable.
