Not sure if I'm projecting a little if I think that this logo is a nod to London and it's status as a world metropolis. If not, it's still an appealling graphic device. It works well as an abstract decorative device, and it's paired nicely with [Gotham](http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/) - helpfully identified in the brand guidelines.

I guess you could separate the graphic and apply it to pretty much anything, which doesn't make it bad - just low risk, which might not be a bad strategy in a digital world where branding is so much more than the logo.
