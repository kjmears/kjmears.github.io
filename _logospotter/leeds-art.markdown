The branding guidelines are well worth a look for this interesting identity. They chart the transition from on old identity that used a distinctive mosaic from the college to the current system that uses an unusual shape to contain the words 'Leeds College of Art'.

There are 4 segments from the mosaic used as containers, giving a useful variety. Allied with the redrawn type - again taken from the mosaic - the mark is a lovely combination of a simple but strong idea, executed very tastefully. The backstory of the mosaic is a good one to have, and I like the confidence the identity and treatment exudes.
