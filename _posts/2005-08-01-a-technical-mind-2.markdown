After a more than brief hiatus caused by much work and then a holiday, here is the latest installment of my @media drawings.

Remembering Douglas' presentations, I was struck by how fastidious he was/is about his designs. Not only the way that they look which is obvious for all to see, but the same eye for detail is used 'under the hood'.

It reminded me of something I once said to our marketing department when they were inputing content into our CMS - that if a page makes sense without design, then the design will probably make sense when added. Not to suggest that the visual design is an afterthought, but that the visuals aren't able to rescue muddled thinking.

The phrase technical mind stuck with me.
