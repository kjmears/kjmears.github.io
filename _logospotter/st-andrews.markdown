As one would probably expect from such an established old institution, the trusty heraldic shield and serif combo has been used to solid, if safe effect.

The colours in the shield look a little bit primary for my taste, lending it a clip art feel. A much more interesting approach is taken by the black and white version of the logo.

the textures lend a more restrained and dare I say, ancient feel.

The serif typeface is [Palatino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino) which has some distinctive calligraphic endings. Aside from a bit of awkwardness around the 'ty' it works well enough, and work better alongside the less strident monochrome shield.
