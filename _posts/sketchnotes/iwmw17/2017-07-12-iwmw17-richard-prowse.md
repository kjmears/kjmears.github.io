Rich is always an engaging speaker, and in this session he had plenty to talk about.  I’ve seen him describe the journey through content strategy at the University of Bath, and this talk was about the experience of building  tools to support that.  There was plenty of good reminders that the landscape content is being released into is changing fast, and so they’re trying to build a tool that accommodates that. The standout for me was incorporating user needs into the content creation process, to remind people that there needs to be a reason for the content to exist, and a measure of how successful it is against that goal. I’ve advocated  a goal based reminder in CMSes for a while and it’s nice to see it happening - I think we’ll see it more and more.

Also good, was the handy reminder that Publishers are users too, and so the tools need to meet the needs of those users too.
