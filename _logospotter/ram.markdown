As with some of the other Royal institutions, the Royal Academy of Music up the ante on the crest/serif combo by using a [Royal Coat of Arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom#England.2C_Wales_and_Northern_Ireland) but unfortunately the large amount of detail makes it unsatisfactory. You can make out the general shapes enough to recognise it, but the detail ends up very indistinct - especially when used on the black background.

The typeface for the text looks like [Goudy](https://www.linotype.com/1983/goudy.html) and is pretty elegant.
