Just finished one of my xmas pressies. Very well illustrated history of the London Underground map, designed by Harry Beck. It illustrates the near obbsesive attention to detail of Mr Beck and shows just why the map has been such a success.

The agonising done by Beck over the smallest details on behalf of the users and how best to portray the complexity of the system to them over the course of 27 years is pretty amazing.

The small but significant change from representing the stations with dots, to small ticks was my favourite revelation.
