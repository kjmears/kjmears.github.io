Hello I'm Kevin Mears

I work as a web designer for the University of South Wales.

One of my earliest memories is of doodling on waste punch cards from the days when computer programs ran on paper, I'm still amazed by technology and love drawing.

I especially like to draw sketchnotes of talks, video, meeting, lectures amongst other things, and you can find lots of those on this site. You'll also sometimes see the results of me tweaking, testing and investigating on this site, preferring to build some knowledge and have fun rather than 'build my brand'. 

I featured in the seminal Zen of CSS Design book and having been designing websites for over 15 years I'm gratified to find that it still excites and delights me.
