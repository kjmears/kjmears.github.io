The upward pointing chevron suggests a tower, maybe an open book,a roof, as well as the more obvious arrow suggesting the upward progress of the graduate.

It's both a strength and a weakness of such a simple shape that the associations come thick and fast but lack some specificity.

Solid [uppercase serif](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/stone-serif/sc-medium/) is more in line with the traditional expectations of a university, whilst the cheltenham and gloucester text seems a bit of an afterthought. Looking like Gill Sans, it's at least discrete and is colour matched with the chevron.

Ultimately, despite the modern element it ends up being quite a conservative logo by virtue of it's minimalism.
