A late substitute to the speaker line up was Andy Clarke, who delivers great presentations, talked about how Responsive Web Design has changed the landscape of how we communicate with clients, and offered some pointers on how we can do this successfully. All delivered without slides, he outlined some of the pitfalls of getting too fixated on design deliverables during the process to the detriment of the atmosphere of the work.

He advocated a better way of getting feedback - by asking the right questions and getting it in a structured and useful way. Getting out there an selling the work to clients and responding to their work is a crucial part of the endeavour - one which I know I need to be better at.
