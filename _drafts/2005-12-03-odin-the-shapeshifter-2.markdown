Lovely drawing by "Rudi":http://rudi.mearso.com/ after I told him that Odin had shapeshifting powers. Its interesting that he picked up on that rather than the usual depiction of Odin as king of the Vikings. 

from "Wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin#General_characteristics

bq. Odin was a shape-changer, able to alter his skin and form in any way he liked. He was said to travel the world as an old man with a staff, one-eyed, grey-bearded, and wearing a wide-brimmed hat
