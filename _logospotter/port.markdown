Called spheres and half-spheres in the logo guidelines, maybe they are a nod to Portsmouths naval history, suggesting portholes on ships. The arrangement just about suggests a 'P'- stretched to breaking point, and so needs the accompanying text which looks to be [Univers](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/).

I like the ultra light weight on top of the heavy word.
