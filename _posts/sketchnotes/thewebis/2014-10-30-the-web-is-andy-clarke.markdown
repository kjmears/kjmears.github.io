Something different for Andy Clarke's session where he recorded an edition of his podcast [Unfinished Business](http://unfinished.bz/) talking about Mental Health and Wellbeing in our industry to coincide with [Geek Mental Help Week](http://geekmentalhelp.com/)

I found it a useful pause to remember that there are people at the other side of theses screen we spend so much time in front of and sometimes need some help.
