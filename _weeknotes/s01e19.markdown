Was a week I've been looking forward to a while, as it was the annual [IWMW event](http://iwmw.org/iwmw2014/programme/) for 3 days where I did my usual thing of sketching to summarize the talks - which can be found [here](mearso.co.uk).

Since this is my weeknote - I'll not turn this into a roundup of the event - suffice to say, as usual the talks were very good and every year as well as catching up with friends I meet new interesting people.

The talk that fired me up to come back to work and make changes most was Ross Fergusons talk about bringing a new culture and way of working to what I do.

Hoping to collect links to the talks and do a better round up later this week.
