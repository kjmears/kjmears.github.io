I can't make up my mind whether this looks like "Andy Farrell":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Farrell or not.

My excuse is that he looked like that when I drew him, druring the England v Italy game in Feb 2007.

I think I would need to bulk him up a bit, because the real thing looks bigger than I've drawn him.
