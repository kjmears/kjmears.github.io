A pdf by the [Design agency](http://www.hat-trickdesign.co.uk/projects/Norwich(2).pdf) responsible for the design calls it a creative spark, and I like the simplicity and energy. The extra scrutiny that arts Univerities logos are no doubt subject to, can lead to the plain approach taken by others, but I like that this logo has made the effort to do more.
