I'm in the final year of my MA in Graphic Communication at the "University of Glamorgan":http://www.glam.ac.uk and have created a little section of my site to publish what I'm working on.

My project is to produce full colour illustrations of my interpretations of a selection of the teams in the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

I intend to use them as a  showcase of the variety of styles that I enjoy producing, and as an opportunity to stretch my capabilities.

I'm also enjoying the discipline of publishing my ideas as I go along and having to refelect on them.
