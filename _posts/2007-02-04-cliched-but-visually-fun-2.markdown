This Inked idea for the Scottish character is a whole bundle of cliches, but I'm thinking that maybe I'd be daft to turn my nose up at a such a fun set of visuals to play with. 

What's not to like about a tartan hat, a busy red beard, and a kilt?

Will try a scratchier version on some properly stretched paper
