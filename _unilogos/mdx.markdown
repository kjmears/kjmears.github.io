A bold red shield with three swords is certainly a striking image, and if your [location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesex) presents you with such an arresting image it seems like a good idea to use it. It've seen other uses of a modern sans-serif with some trendy spurless letters not work too well, but the shield dominates and doesn't allow the text to distract with those mannered spurless bits [check out the great poster from Fontsmith](http://fontsmith-assets.com/enlargements/1/60a0c11945a9a531c38c80fce4ee360e/FSTypeTerms.pdf) to learn what 'spurless' is.

Special mention should go to the [Website](http://www.mdx.ac.uk) for the massive overuse of red.
