This is a very early idea for the illustration for the France rugby character/team. It has very obvious echos of "A.M.Cassandre":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Muron_Cassandre , but hopefully I can develop away from that.

However, I've always liked the textured gradients that you see in his and his contemporaries work, and now is my chance to give it a try. 

I'm a firm believer that by trying to emulate a particular style you learn a lot about it, and provided that imitation is not your aim, you can develop your own take on it.
