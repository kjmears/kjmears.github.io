<blockquote>With a solid base underpinned by authority and heritage, they can be free to express their creativity and innovative nature.</blockquote>

From the development of the existing brand that has been undertaken by Neville Brody's [research studios](https://web.archive.org/web/20140723155313/http://www.researchstudios.com/2013/01/31/royal-college-of-art-identity-development/)(Courtesy of the Web Archive)

The rollout of the new brand hasn't made it to the main site at the time of writing, but the changes aren't huge. With such a big reputation the RCA doesn't need to try too hard with it's identity, instead using it's visual capital simply. A nicely drawn crest and some modern serifs is a pretty neutral understated treatmment that says 'we are the Royal College, and we don't need to shout about it'.
