I Am Love,2009,2022-11-08,Drama,"I do like a slow visually interesting film were not much happens, and Tilda Swinton is as a charismatic as everâ€¦.However, it did take an awfully long time to get there.
Guadagnino showed that he can do drama when the minimal plot does play out.
Frustrating, but it just about comes out ahead for me since there's some other themes to think about, if i was a proper critic.",DVD,https://boxd.it/10ac

Untold: Crimes & Penalties,2021,2022-01-11,Documentary,"The patriarch was a weird mix of Derek Hatton and will Ferrell.
An orgy of pretty nasty self aggrandising bullshit. I really think they buy the shit they're selling.
They cheated like fuck at everything they did. slightly redeemed by the son getting out from under.",Netflix,https://boxd.it/woAq
Untold: Malice at the Palace,2021,2022-01-10,Documentary,"Liked the District Attorney who did his job properly. The racial bias of the 'thug' and hip-hop narrative was depressing, as was the hot takes from all the news anchors losing their shit and their perspective. Especially denouncing highly paid athletes who've risen to the top in a field that I'd suggest is a bit more competitive than autocue fed mannequins.
The fan who still deludes himself that a cheap shot was all that stood between him and glory - was nice to see the makes give him all the rope he needed.
It seemed good that the players had mostly come to terms with the whole thing - even despite the injustice of it all.",Netflix,https://boxd.it/wnUa
