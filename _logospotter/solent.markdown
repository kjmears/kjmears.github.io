I couldn't see anything in the <a href="http://www.solent.ac.uk/guidelines/brandguidelines.aspx">guidelines</a> explaining what the graphic element of this logo is all about. It looks like a scribbled starburst - perhaps signifying energy and dynamism in that oblique and abstract way that logos often claim to.

It certainly is lively and bold and as such a good a mark as any. More problematic for me is the combination of a Garamond-esque Uppercase 'Solent' in between some Gills Sans-ish 'Southampton' and "University'. The larger serifed S jars against the clean and confident nature of the rest of the logo. Strangely the uppercase serif seems a timid conservative choice in an otherwise sprightly idea.
