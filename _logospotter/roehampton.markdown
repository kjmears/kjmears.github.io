Reading a little about the University and it's history I thought that the four quarters of this logo might refer to the original constituent colleges. However, checking [the infomation about them](http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/Colleges/) it seems they each have their own distinct coats of arms, which bear no relation to the graphic patterns of the main logo.

The geometric yellow, red and navy patterns of the logo remind me of [naval flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags). The yellow background combined with the black and yellow certainly give some road-sign urgency even if the reasoning is unclear.

The Typeface looks like Helvetica, and the sparse modernist feel is unfortunately a little undermined by the 'London' beneath the underline - which looks tacked on as an afterthought.
