Using Gill Sans in white on a blue background seems a pretty safe, modern-ish option for this logo, but it's then accompanied by a particularly awkward gold 'S' curve on a pale blue square. It's not immediately obvious what (if anything) the shape is alluding to which only makes the random nature of the curve worse. It certainly isn't a graceful shape, not helped by the way that it protrudes out of the top of the box.

The brand guidelines do a valiant job of defending the space around the logo to make it work, but I'm not sure the idea of an abstract shape that can be used to provide some suggestion of dynamism or energy works when the shape is so distracting and puzzling.
