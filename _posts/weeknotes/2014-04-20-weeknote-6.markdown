Short week this week with the Easter holidays.

Pace is picking up a little with the latest site I'm working on. As usual, despite one's best intentions to be more organised there's nothing like as fast approaching deadline to concentrate the mind. The time for trying out options and ideas has to stop sometime.

Despite our best intentions to be [content first](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1598) it's been tricky to get everything up front, but It's been a big improvement on past projects I've worked on, and It's gratifying to be able to put more design thought into the work. Hopefully, this will show through in the end result.
