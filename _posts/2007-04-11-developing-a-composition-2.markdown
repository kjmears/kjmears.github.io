Been a little stuck whilst working through this illustration on the Mac, so decided to go back to the more traditional method of working out a composition.

Drawing is still quicker and more responsive. I also find the direct nature of drawing and erasing is better for testing ideas quickly.

I think doing this composition on the the Mac would have lead to me getting too concerned with detail.
