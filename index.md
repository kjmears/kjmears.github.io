Hello I'm Kevin Mears.

I've had a varied career at the same organization for over 30 years - this site is a place to post thoughts and play around in the grand tradition of the early days of the web. Still a noble idea. I especially like to draw **[sketchnotes][sketch]** of talks, video, meeting, lectures amongst other things, and you can find lots of those on this site. I also had fun for a few years, collecting and reviewing UK university logos, which you can find in the imaginatively titled **[unilogos][logos]** section.
