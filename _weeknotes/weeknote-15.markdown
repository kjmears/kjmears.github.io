Short 3 day week, so the only noteworthy thing I can remember from this week was some work speccing out some content fields needed for quotes across the site.

Reading that back it sounds very much like jargon. The proper explanation is that on various sites there are quotes from people about what it's like to study at university or how they found the course. The quotes can be quite large blocks of text and it would be good to make them easier to read and draw more attention with more obvious indication that it is a direct quote 

Ideally, it would be as simple as content people marking up the quote or blockquote and then then a default style being applied across the site. However, as is often the case a blanket styling throughout a big site isn't good enough.

So we need to be able make the content more structured to get us the ability to be more flexible and appropriate with out styles. This is where the work I've done comes in - though it can be tough to explain that a seemingly simple request, can be more complex to implement in a sensible and useable way. I'm sure people sometimes think we're overcomplicating things, so I guess the onus is on me to better explain why what I'm suggesting will be better in the long run.
