Sketchnote of Talk by Robin Christopherson at Port80 conference

Robin gave a very entertaining and inspiring insight into just how empowering and revolutionary technology can be for disabled people; and reminded everyone that disability will come to everyone at some point. It was also very easy to sketch because of the concrete examples and ideas he used and demonstrated.
