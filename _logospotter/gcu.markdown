A shape that reminds me of pictures of an eclipse combined with curious shaped serifs on a three letter abbreviation which puts me in mind of a nineties <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=corporate+document+wallet&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zKwCUo27MsaZ0QW9tYGoAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQsAQ&amp;biw=1076&amp;bih=695#facrc=_&amp;imgrc=IQiPXXaJYyO6_M%3A%3BM0x9fiTZGRRy_M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.suitsmen.co.uk%252Fsuit-images%252Ffull-size%252Fleather-document-wallet-1.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.suitsmen.co.uk%252Faccessories%252F231%252F%3B1134%3B1701">Corporate Document Wallet</a> and a profitable but dull business.

The aforementioned serifs are very exaggerrated in what seems to be an attempt to give a modern, dyanmic feel to the text but doesn't really work for me. The nicest part of the whole wordmark is the simple Glasgow Caledonian University text. I think it works in contrast to the unresolved other elements of the logo.

Strangely, the logo works much better on the <a href="http://www.gcu.ac.uk">website</a> where all the elements are more unified by being on the same line.
