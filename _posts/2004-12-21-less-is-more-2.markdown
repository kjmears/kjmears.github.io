Just watched the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I haven't been following the reviews and haven't read any of the books, but I thought it was an entertaining diversion. There were some nice set-peices, some imaginative good-guys and a few decent gadgets. I can imagine that the characters might have a bit more latitude for mystery in printed form, as there was quite a bit of exposition instead of the plot, which seemed to peter out a bit towards the end. 

Overall, it seemed to have a little too much ambition in that it tried to deliver a whole band of interesting characters and there seemed insufficient time to develop them all.

Though in common with many big sfx hits of recent times there are lots of big things. Perhaps too many. Like lots of other blockbusting effects-laden movies there seems to be a tendency to chuck lots of things in. Then some more. Then add some more.

For example,in this film the Nautilus, seemed to me to be just too big. The scene where it emerges from the river to pick the gang up is just ridiculous. Venice appears to sitting in an ocean, not a lagoon. 

This then reminded me of some other examples

* The Matrix Reloaded, Zion Dance Party scene where as far as the eye could see the surving human race was partying hard to no discernable sound source.
* Star Wars EpisodeIV Phantom Menace - How many droids do you need to really get the message home that the baddies are coming? 
* LOTR  return of the King's finial battle scene, was hugely enjoyable,but did it really need to be SO BIG?

To convey the scale of the baddies evil ambitions their dastardly armies are ranged as far as the eye can see,or in tardis like old castles. 

With their obvious ability to create (and hide) gargantuan factories of evil in the blink of an all-seeing eye, these villans could clean up by developing a chain of forbidding castles on prime real estate selling reasonably priced branded evilware, I sure they could enjoy a far more leisurely career in world domination.

I am alone in wanting a little more quality and less quantity from my bad guys?
