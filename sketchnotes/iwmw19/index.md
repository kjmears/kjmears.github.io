This was big step up for me.

I stood up and did some drawing - which I really enjoyed. Judging by the number of people who said nice things, lost of others enjoyed what I did. 

The general impression for me of this years' event was of super-efficient organisation, some great experimental approaches to talk and workshop formats and the palpable sense of community that comes from having so many people pitching in.
