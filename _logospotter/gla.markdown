A more established University, following the well worn crest/serif path, but in this case the shield is in a very illustrative style with the elements from [the life of St Mungo](http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/coat-of-arms/) the patron saint of Glasgow. It's a bold, colourful treatment which enlivens the safe choice of Garamond that sits alongside.
