Discovered a nice climb around the back of Talbot Green, which winds up into the forest. Although the road is narrow the surface is very good, as you can see from the next picture.

On the way down now, the road widens and sweeps nicely down for a mile or two until you emerge on the busy road to Tonyrefail

After having cycled up a little way from Tonyrefail you're rewarded with a pleasant ride through the country lanes, and when you can see above the hedge you can see for miles

The Stats:
Distance 35.79 km
Average Speed 23.94km/h
Ride Time 1:29:49
Max 74 km/h (think this is an error on the Bike Computer!)
Could be right though.
