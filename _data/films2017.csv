The Ipcress File,2017-02-20,"Visually interesting throughout, sharp and cool - Michael Caine at his best. ""My name is HARRY PALMER""",15247
Chicago,2017-02-21,"Apparently, I like musicals now. ",1574

Lord of War,2017-02-28,"Watchable, if perhaps a little jolly for what is at heart a pretty depressing trade.",1830

The Searchers,2017-03-04,"Some dodgy politics, but epic and with unexpected funny bits.",3114

The Night of the Hunter,2017-03-21,"Great lighting making a great looking film with a superb Robert Mitchum, but a weird ending.",3112
Prisoners,2017-03-25,Nice twists and tension - So many thrillers aren't thrilling. This was certainly tense and very good.,146233
Five Easy Pieces,2017-03-29,"Jack Nicholson effortlessly tormented, restless and charismatic.",26617

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,2017-04-26,"Jolly good fun, once it'd built up some steam.",330459

Black Swan,2017-04-28,Wasn't sure what to expect - it was a corker. Melodramatic in the very best way.,44214
High Rise,2017-04-29,"Started well, but got gradually less interesting. Reached peak montage about two thirds of the way in.",254302
Brother,2017-04-30,You'd think that people who's trade is killing would be harder to kill. All in giant 90s suits. Is nihilistic Zen a thing?,327

Near Dark,2017-05-04,The baddies were the best thing about it. Honourable mention for music ,11879
Sink the Bismarck!,2017-05-06,"Steady as she goes - probably last of the Germans = Bad, British = Good type war films.",18780
The Accountant,2017-05-06,"Patchy. Strong action, bit lame on the inner angst, and mixed on the plot twists. Decent fun, if a bit long.",302946

A Matter of Life and Death,2017-06-24,"Super saturated colour, melodramatic performances and weird ideas - pretty tidy.",28162
Hacksaw Ridge,2017-06-25,A feel good good war movie seems an oymoron. It was good apart from the fetishised slo-motion that seems ubiquitous in war movies these days.,324786
The Infiltrator,2017-06-25,"Plenty of the usual undercover tropes, but expertly handled.",325789
Babel,2017-06-26,"Trilogy of tragedies. Exhausting at times because of the tension, but beautifully put together.",1164
Elizabeth: The Golden Age,2017-06-27,Elizabeth: The Golden Age ,4517

Field of Dreams,2017-07-03,Just about the right side of schmaltz. Endearingly strange.,2323
City of God,2017-07-16,"Fast paced, snappy and stylish, which didn't wholly seem right considering the depressing subject. In the end was kinda ok about it, but a bit ambivalent",598
Monsters,2017-07-22,"Not a lot happens, but interesting nonetheless. Funnily, not a monsters film.",43933
Legend,2017-07-25,"Tom Hardy was interesting as always, but was mostly bored and sometimes irritated.",276907
Hidden Figures,2017-07-27,"Really enjoyable, but couldn't shake the feeling that things should be a lot further on than they are.",381284
Ivan's Childhood,2017-07-29,Beautifully composed and strangely domestic feel for a war film. I guess it isn't really a war film.,31442
War Machine,2017-07-29,"One of those films where if you've seen the trailer, you seen most of the best bits. Extra star for Tilda Swinton.",354287
John Wick,2017-08-09,Above average for a modern action film - which isn't saying much.Kinda fun signature 'shoot 'em up close' move. Special mention for a truly awful song in the soundtrack.,245891

The Odessa File,2017-08-16,"Bit broad strokes at times, but decent enough.",21489
Shell,2017-08-28,Claustraphobic in wide open space. Tense.,135990
A Woman under the Influence,2017-09-10,Compelling but uncomfortable viewing. Everyone seemed on the edge at sometime. Manic.,29845

The Beckoning Silence,2017-09-16,Eloquent explanation of why people climb mountains.,58820
Killer Nun,2017-09-19,"Loopy, trippy and a bit nasty. Bit like the 70s.",42211
Helvetica,2017-09-20,"Broader than the title suggests, both a strength and a weakness.",13348
Control,2017-09-24,Monochrome and monotone - Samantha Morton had depth - more than the script. Maybe cos I was unsure about watching it in the first place it felt off.,5708
The Handmaid's Tale,2017-09-26,Felt longer. I guess the money spent on Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall meant they couldn't stretch to a decent script.,20815
Moana,2017-09-27,Winning combination of cheesy and trippy bundled up in brilliant animation,277834
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,2017-09-30,"I wished the jokes were as funny as the writers thought they were. And the plot was pretty thin. Apart from that, was ok.",283995
Lifeboat,2017-10-01,Interesting bit of not too subtle propaganda which overdid it a bit at the end.,13321
Shadows,2017-10-01,"Manic and staccato energy to the whole thing, interesting but not exactly satisfying. ",15484

Wuthering Heights,2017-10-12,Pretty gruelling. Stylistically as well as emotionally. Certainly memorable.,9364
Snowden,2017-10-15,"Standard bio pic, never quite sure what isreal or extra drama. Laid on thick at the end.",302401
Jon Wick:Chapter 2,2017-10-17,"Started annoyingly silly, got amusingly ridiculous, then a bit boring and then engagingly stupid again.",324552

Unbroken,2017-10-21,By the numbers bio-pic.,227306

Blade Runner 2049,2017-10-23,I liked the pace and plot. Slicked back hair is evidently the sign of baddie now. Lost points for the sound - ran out of ideas and used generic too loud rumbles - crap.,335984
Billion Dollar Brain,2017-10-23,"Favourite bits were Michael Caine and the sixties computers, the rest was a bit too mental.",4889
Ratcatcher,2017-10-25,A poetic journey through the wringer. Gotta watch it.,29698

The Vietnam War,2017-11-06,Essential viewing,476618
Eyes of Laura Mars,2017-11-08,"There really was lots of everything in the seventies. Hair, smoking, rubbish, lingerie, and drama.",29143
Southpaw,2017-11-11,Usual boxing tropes. Unsubtle signposting with music throughout.,307081

The Man Who Wasn't There,2017-11-25,Turns out Noir is kind of soothing.,10778

Red River,2017-12-11,Slightly lame ending.,3089

The Happy Film,2017-12-14,Engaging,390298
Mirror,2017-12-17,"Enjoyed the quiet bits the best. Entrancing shots, but the reflections and poetry left me a bit cold.",1396

Only God Forgives,2017-12-18,Tarantino meets Malick with a dash of Lynch.,77987
Saturn 3,2017-12-19,"This is tricky. 4 starts for the fun I had watching it, 1 star for the quality.

The Wolverine,2017-12-29,Logan sure does carry a lot of films.,263115
