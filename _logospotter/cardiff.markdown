The combination of the differing [word order systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_syntax#Word_order) of English and Welsh is used to create a word-mark with top - bottom symmetry. Both languages are rendered in a typeface that seems to be a combination inscriptional/sans-serif, that also manages to suggest calligraphy. The subtle curves on the strokes and the different sizes of the letters create a craft-like effect that seems to be a nod to the celtic roots of Wales, similar in feel to that used on the [Wales Millenium Centre](http://images.google.co.uk/search?q=wales%20millenium%20centre&biw=1431&bih=1068&sei=qb7nTpKLGJCzhAfq-bSzCg&tbm=isch#q=wales+millenium+centre&hl=en&safe=off&tbm=isch&tbas=0&source=lnt&sa=X&ei=sb7nTrK8I4jAhAfJ_uG2Cg&ved=0CAwQpwUoAA&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&fp=7d23b0624018d550&biw=1431&bih=1068) The simple placement of rectangles above each other, in effect combines two logos, and they are brought together by the muted red.
