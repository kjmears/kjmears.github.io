Looking back, through some very old things on the site I found some drawings from @meda2005 - my first conference, and as I see now the start of me drawing during talks. This it what I wrote at the time.

>Well, so many things and so little space in my head.

>Managed to speak to <a href="http://www.molly.com">Molly</a> and thank her for my chapter in CSS Zen Garden book. Which Kev Evans managed to mention at almost every opportunity. I can see now where she gets the energy to write all those books!

>Managed to rather embarass myself by asking [Joe Clark](http://www.joeclark.org) a stupid question about captions/subtitles whilst drunk, I can only hope his pointed explanation of the difference between them the next day, wasn't just for my benefit. He also rather threw me by asking for a shoe phone - presumably not some kind of Bulgarian secret police gadget, but a slighty larger than usual feature laden phone.

>Very pleased to speak to [Mark](http://www.markboulton.co.uk) and [Simon](http://www.simonrooney.com) from the BBC, and get into a discussion about typefaces.

>[Ed](http://www.ebcomley.co.uk) played spot the [Threadless](http://www.threadless.com) t-shirt with amongst others, [Jon](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk)

>Would've liked to talk more with [Denis](http://www.38one.com/) who must be delighted that his lovely logo looked great on the orange bags.

>One particular pleasure was the drawings I did as a memory aid of each presentation. The best of these was this one of [Andy Budd](http://www.andybudd.co.uk)
