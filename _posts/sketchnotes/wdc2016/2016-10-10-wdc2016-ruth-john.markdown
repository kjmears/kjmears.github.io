I've seen Ruth talk [once before][localhost], when she talked about the fiendish sounding shadow DOM. Obviously some kind of mascohist, she attempted live demo of technology and was beset by technical glitches with the in-house projector. Whilst annoying, she pressed on and gave a really interesting introduction to MIDI, focusing on the 'Digital Interface' bit of the acronym.

Nice demos and good to see what digital pioneers are bringing back from the fronteer.
