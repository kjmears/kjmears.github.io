What to do when you've done a drawing and then realised that it might just be a little too close to another person's distinctive styel for comfort.

That is the question for me now that I've done this drawing, which dismayed me when I looked at it. In itself I liked it. I liked the way of drawing - a mostly continuous line - but after it was done I realised that perhaps people might say ut looks too much like a certain "Jon Burgerman":http://www.jonburgerman.com/index.php/Work

Perhaps I should keep ploughing on with the continous line until I come out the other side with my own style
