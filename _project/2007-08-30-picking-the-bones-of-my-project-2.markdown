title: Thoughts on handing in my work

excerpt: Well the time has finally arrived when I have to hand in all the work I've
  been doing on this project. Unlike previous projects where I've procrastinated rather
  than write an overview of the whole thing I've resolved to be good and strike while
  the iron is hot.

I initially wanted to do something different to what I've done. I was overambitious in wanting to produce a partial book with illustrations about the teams in the RWC07, but I was wisely advised against. Instead I've produced some character based illustrations which I'm pretty happy with. 

I managed to avoid my usual mistake when being given a brief which is to somehow try to conform to an 'ideal' of working that I seem to have picked up when in college. I used to be envious of all the people who seem very good at collecting source material and filling scrapbooks with really interesting and stimulating imagery related to their projects. I have nether the patience or the attention to create these books, but that hasn't eased my frustration. However, I've not realised that approach isn't for me. I prefer to draw from memory, and then seek out reference material when necessary. This works for me, but it's taken me a long time to realise it.

One difficult aspect of the work this year has been building up some momentum. It seemed that as soon as I got started I had to leave things for a while, and return to give the project impetus again. Once I got going, the work has been great fun. 

One of the things that was stressed at the start of this year was the requirement for us to move out of our comfort zones with regard to our working methods and styles. I think I have managed to do this, and am glad I gave it a go. It would have been easy to produce nice work, all in the same style, but I've got plenty of time to work however I want when the course is done.

Overall I'm pretty pleased with the work I'm gonna hand in, though I fully expect there to be lots of "Doh! I could've done that!" moments as soon as I hand it over.

The next big job is to work on the final show and how that is gonna look.

Then I really will have finished!
