Hello I'm Kevin Mears

I work as a web designer for the University of South Wales. I also like to draw as much as I can, one of my earliest memories is of doodling on waste punch cards from the days when computer programs ran on paper.

I especially like to draw sketchotes of talks, video, meeting, lectures amongst other things. 

I featured in the seminal Zen of CSS Design book and having been designing websites for over 15 years I'm gratified to find that it still excites and delights me.
