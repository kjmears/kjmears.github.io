'Connecting' - is apparently a key concept - as outlined in the corporate guidelines. One can see the thinking of connecting the different sites that make up the university in an abstract enough way that makes for some visual interest. 'UCS' seems to be less cumbersome than 'University Campus Suffolk' hence the simple and bold treatment. I like that they have eschewed a grand concept in favour of a simple idea done simply.
