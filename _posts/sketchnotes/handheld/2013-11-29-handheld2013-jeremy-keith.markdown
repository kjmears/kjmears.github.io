I've seen Jeremy speak twice before and each time was a wide ranging and interesting snapshot of a topic, so I was expecting more of what had worked well in the past. This felt different - the same overview and context of a wider web was still there but he talked through the redesign and refactoring of <a href="http://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. Nicely relating everyday development of a site to the principle of preservation and the future friendly web.
