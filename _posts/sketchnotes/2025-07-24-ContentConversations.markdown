It has been such a long time since I've been out to a tech/content meetup, so I was very glad to go along to the [Content Design London][cdl] organised 'Content Conversations'. The experience of a nice train ride, including a chat with an old colleague, on a lovely summer's evening was a great start. I rocked up on time and had some nice chats, met some new people who I'd only previously seen virtually, and saw some old friends who've gone on twisty content journeys' since I last saw [them][jenni] [speak][rich]

Adrian talked about his journey to Service Design encountering careless design on the way, which neatly segued into taking care of your team to deliver good services.

Heledd went into some detail about the team's journey particularly the unglamorous but deep work of taking 'forms' (usually in Word) and turning them in real usable online forms. 

Nathan had a nice epiphany about service design and involving young users to give some insights and then co-design solutions based on them.
