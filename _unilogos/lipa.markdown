I've generally tried to be positive about the logos I've looked at on this site, but this logo is a car crash. The serifs are indistinct,and terminate the letters in disagreeable ways - most notably on the 'L'. The bowl on the P is anything but elegant, and to cap it all of the text underneath is illegible.
