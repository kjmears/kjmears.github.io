I fell off the horse.

Thanks to the example of plenty of GDS and GovCampCyrmu people I'm getting back on the writing horse.

Today I wrote something in my sketchbook (in big markers - part of my plan to be bolder in some of my thinking and writing) 'Things that are fast should be slow and vice versa'. I know, nonsense. What I was thinking at the time was that some of my frustrations around design/development workflows stem from us taking too long with some things that should be relatively straightforward, and not spending nearly enough time on other things. Things like user research to explore user needs and then a thorough translation of them into actionable user stories.
