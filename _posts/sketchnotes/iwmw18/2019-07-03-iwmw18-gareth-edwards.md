I was looking forward to Gareth's talk based on the topic and the knowledge that he is one of those strange people that don't seem to get nervous and actively enjoys public speaking. He didn't disappoint.

The whole concept of task switching is something that everyone does, yet no-one has a plan for dealing with it. Until now.

Super interesting process talk about the detail of doing knowledge work. Expertly delivered.
