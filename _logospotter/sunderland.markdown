Known as 'the spark' in the brand guidelines this a bold graphic device. It reminds of a volcano and such an obviously dynamic thing wouldn't look out of place in a vorticist publication.

I found it vaguely reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=illuminati+pyramid&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z9pqUsr3OKib0QXJp4DABA&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1276&amp;bih=783" title="Illuminati Pyramid">Illuminati Pyramid</a> (which btw, is an entertaining 10 mins of crazy).

Whatever it suggests to me it's certainly energetic, though quite a tricky shape to get text to work with. I don't think the choice of a very heavy <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/futura_std_extrabold/ot_ps">Futura</a> provides any much needed variety to the logo. The overall feel is very dense and it would have been nice to see the typeface compliment the strength of the spark.
