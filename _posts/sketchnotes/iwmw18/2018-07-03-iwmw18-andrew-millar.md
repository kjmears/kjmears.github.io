Andrew's opening bit about the severe panic attack that he experienced was a great way in to one of the conference highlights. If you saw [his talk last year][last], you'll understand that Andrew and his team at Dundee have been doing tons of great work, and perhaps this talk showed a little of the personal cost of such demanding work.

A great counterpart to [Alison's talk][alison] this one also struck a chord.
