For me, this has always been an iconic modernist logo. According to <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/branding_28">this correspondence looking for brand info</a>, the logo was designed in-house by the Head of Design in 1969.

Whilst the brand guidelines aren't available,<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dingridsystem/sets/72157631016077100/">this flickr set is a Fascinating peek at the extensive document.</a>

The original, flat logo is an elegant combination of the letters creating a versatile and lasting brand. As <a href="http://www.davidairey.com/what-makes-a-good-logo/">covered on Daivid Airey's logo love</a> there is also a subtle nod to the historical use of <a href="shef.html" title="University of Sheffield">shields</a> in <a href="cam.html" title="University of Cambridge">other</a> university branding. I'm not sure what the addition of the gradients and shadow to the logo are meant to achieve. For me. they are just modish distractions from a basic classic.

Also worth mentioning is the University's misson for distance learning meant that there was a very strong motion graphics component to the brand. Generations grew up with the Open University idents on day time and late night television as seen in this youtube video

Finally, I can't mention the Open University without linking to this Fry and Laurie sketch.
