## Updated

Clear, no nonsense but not without some subtlety.

Changing from the animal based, slightly 'bankish' previous logo to a more direct and simply stated proposition. Aside from what seems a controversial association with Manchester, provoking some [none too flattering coverage](http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=1033), the logo is plain but works well.

Nicely balanced with the different weights and colours providing a simple hierachy.

I couldn't work out the clean sans serif that is used, but the condensed and slightly square letterforms make for a compact and bold overall device. Whilst looking for the typeface, I came across the the marvellous [Salford Type Foundry](http://salfordtypefoundry.co.uk/)

## Previous logo

Tidying up exercise on Salford's roundel described in the corporate guidelines. The supporting text around the Lion [in a pose called rampant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(heraldry)) has been made bolder, larger and simpler, whilst also removing some ornamentation. Like the simplicity of just one lion. A strong character in a dynamic pose free of distractions alludes to the history suggested by a coat of arms, without labouring the point. The circular shape is a strong mark when done with simply and with confidence. Was reminded me of the [Midland Bank Griffin](http://www.logorip.com/)

The wordmark is in sentence case and set in Frutiger, which adds a light touch to the overall mark. Also nice to see the university happy to be have a less formal feel rather than the more common uppercase.

A calming and fresh choice of green for the wordmark, contrasting nicely with the burgundy of the lion.
