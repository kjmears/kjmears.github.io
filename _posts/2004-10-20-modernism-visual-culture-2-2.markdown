Analysed this advert during our critical design lecture.

The ad is from an issue of Nova magazine in 1965. The background is a set for the two obviously wealthy people to share with the third object in the space - the volvo. The man is being attentive to the female, whilst maintaining a firm grip on her shoulder. This is in contrast to woman who lightly grasps her pearl necklace as her other hand caresses the bonnet of the car.

She assumes the common attitude of the female in adverts of passive and receptive of the gifts being lavished on her. 

<txp:image id="84" />In this detail we can see that neither of the actors return the viewer's gaze. The man is busy enjoying the fruits of his labours, whilst she is receptive of his attentions.

The message is clear - For the woman, this car can transport you to a richer, more glamorous and fulfilled place. For the man, this car displays your wealth and status and enables you to enjoy the fruits of your labour.

With the tagline ??three's company?? (set in lowercase) the product seeks to informally confirm her (the car is a she) rightful place in your life, alongside your other female. There is no appeal to the couple - all the text speaks directly to the male.
