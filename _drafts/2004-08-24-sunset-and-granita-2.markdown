Here is my holiday sunrise pic. Taken from the hotel balcony at about 5.30 in the morning.

For the first 7 days the weather was really hot and sunny, it was amazing how quickly it got warm when the sun came up.

Rudi trying out a Menthol flavoured "Granita":http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_145,00.html Never tried it before and the menthol was very sweet but still managed to be refreshing

The Palazzo del Popolo in Pesaro during the day. It was wonderful to ride the bikes borrowed from the hotel through the main street and emerge into the square into a scene not unlike "Bicycle Thieves":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040522/
