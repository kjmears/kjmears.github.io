Some stuff about <span class="me">me.</span>

Kevin is one of those strange breed who work in-house as a front-end developer. A sign of how geeky (and old) he is, one of his earliest memories is of doodling on waste punch cards from the days when programs ran on paper. He draws as much as possible.

Featured in the seminal Zen of CSS Design book and having been designing websites for over 15 years he's gratified to find that it still excites and delights him. He will emerge blinking into the sunlight in November to talk about some of the things he's noticed along the way.

Kevin will be pondering what the shape of a desk has to do with designing for mobile.
