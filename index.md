I've had a varied career in design, development and information management for over 30 years. 

Many years ago featured in the seminal **[Zen of CSS Design][zen]** book, I also wrote a little book of my own on [Sketchnoting][pocket]

This is a place to post thoughts and play around in the grand tradition of the early days of the web. I occasionally **[blog][blog]**. I especially like to draw **[sketchnotes][sketch]**, and you can find lots of those on this site. I had fun collecting and reviewing UK university logos, which you can find in the imaginatively titled **[unilogos][logos]** section. I try to log what films and [books][books] I've consumed, so I know where all the time goes. My [Weeknotes][weeknotes] are sporadic - but aren't everyone's?
