## Leadership 101 â€“ top tips for steering the ship through the seas of change

This workshop session was more than some dry examination of 'leadership' - I'm sure we've all sat through our share of those. Perhaps why this went well was the desire in the room to recognise ourselves in the styles described and work out ways forward. This was the afternoon of the first day and I'd already had a few conversations with people in teams being reviewed or restructured,  so the bits where people talked about the importance of leadersip through change was a precursor of lots of the sessions and conversations to follow. The categorising of problems according to tame, critical and wicked was new to me, and will give me some homework to go through Claire's slides.
