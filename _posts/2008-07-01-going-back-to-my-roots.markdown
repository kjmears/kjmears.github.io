Enjoyed creating this simple drawing. I was laying down drawing whilst listening to the telly, with the felt pens laid out in front of me like I used to do when I was around 9. My old back and shoulders don't seem to have the stamina I used to, but I did think it was a useful exercise in getting me to take more time with my drawings.

It was good to concentrate less on what the drawing was gonna turn out like , and just enjoy the process.

As it turned out I quite like the shapes and colours.
