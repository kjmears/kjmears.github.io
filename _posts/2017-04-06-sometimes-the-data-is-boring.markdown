For reasons unknown to even me, I was looking at the UCISA website whilst watching an interesting stream from the event held recently. It got me thinking about all the special interest groups and subsequent committees that I'm sure are exclusive to Higher Education organizations, but do have a special place in their collective hearts. So I took a look at the membership of the organization with a view to see how many Universities were represeneted.

I ended up learning all about the association and it's memberships

In my current enthusiasm for charts and spreadsheets I thought I crack my knuckles and see what I could glean.
