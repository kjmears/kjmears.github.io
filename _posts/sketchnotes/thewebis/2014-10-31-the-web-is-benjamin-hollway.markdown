I think Benjamin Hollway slightly scared everyone over 30 in the audience by being so precocious. He gave a good talk about younger devs and what we can do to help them along. My constructive criticism would be to talk more about himself - the story of coding from age 8 is way more extraordinary than it probably feels to him - I think lots of people would love to hear more about that specifically.
