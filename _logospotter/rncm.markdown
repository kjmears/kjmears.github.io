Not sure what the typeface is, but maybe something like [Pluto](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/hvd-fonts/pluto-sans?utm_source=fontsquirrel.com&utm_medium=matcherator_link&utm_campaign=plutosans) as a basis for the fancy decorative tail of the 'R'.

I like the simplicity and airiness, and wonder if the fancy tail is needed. The decorative underlining is pleasant enough without being distracting, and the full text supports the abbreviation nicely. For some reason it's omitted on the website and it looks weaker.

Nice to see that just because Royal is in the title, it doesn't automatically mean serif.
