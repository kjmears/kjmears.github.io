My response to the very interesting @media presentation on the managment of the css design process. It was great to see that I'm not alone in struggling with long stylesheets and being afraid to tidy up and take stuff out because you can't remember what hack you're using, or what menu method, or what image replacement, the list goes on.

I've known for a longtime that my commenting of css is pretty poor, but the presentation has given me the kick up the arse to comment things.

Rachel's words particularly stuck with me "It doesn't matter what the method is, as long as you have one"

As for my drawing, I've decided that I need metaphors to help me understand and absorb things from a session. I've learnt that it's hopeless to try to remember evertyhing, and one has to try to pick out things of relevance to yourself.

For this session the different approaches of the speakers called for different representations.

This is the original drawing
