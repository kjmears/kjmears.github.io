Tasted my free wine this weekend and can say that I enjoyed it. Not a wine connoisseur by any means, but thought it was nice and fresh. My preference is for a drier wine. 

The psychology of drinking a free bottle of wine was interesting. It had already had created a little excitment from arriving unannounced by post, on top of the constant reminder of it's 'freeness' created by the special label. So when I opened the neatly designed and explanatory screwcap, I was ready to like it, but by the same token I was also ready to judge it. 

The wine had said to me "I'm free! Like Me!" and then I had to decide if I was to be extra harsh and scrutinise it more than I normally would, or would I say "what the hell" and get it down my neck.

In the end I did a bit of both. Quick scrutiny and pretend I know what I'm doing, followed by quaffing.
