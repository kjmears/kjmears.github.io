A logo that seems to hark back to the late seventies, with a bold, even garish colour scheme, a grid like representation of a globe, overlaid with panels rather incongruously throwing in more traditional elements of book and bugles.

The globe and panes combine with the font to create a nostalgic feel, free of the softer swirls, swooshes and treatments of modern logos. I guess not intentional, but the bugles seem to suggest some kind of global postal service.

Overall, it seems unabashed by it's awkwardness and the choice of [Avant Garde Gothic](http://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/Classics/AvantGardeGothicPro.htm), enhances the retro feel. A bold choice, that certainly makes it stand out. Even if I can't help thinking it could have a bit part in [this video](http://youtu.be/2un9rO2ZF4g), whilst being accompanied by [this tune](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Belbury-Poly-Logotone/dp/B001P4JIZI)
