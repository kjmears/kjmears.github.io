Work in progress on my idea of England as a formidible (yet fun!) army of rugby playing robots. Perhaps a little unfair on the talented players, but I'm the boss - and I couldn't miss the chance to draw some robots. It really took me back to afternoons in fornt of the TV drawing spaceships and robots when I was a child.
