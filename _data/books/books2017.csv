The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,Philp K Dick,,,,2017-01-17,"As crazy as ever, and often tricky to follow the flips in and out of realities, but ultimately very inventive and enjoyable book.",,0575074809,http://amzn.to/2kbQPzy,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,Search on Amazon
The Long Race to Glory: How the British Came to Rule the Cycling World,Chris Sidwells,,,,2017-01-22,"Not much more than a timeline through British Cycling history, namechecking loads of people along the way. Not a huge amount of analysis.",,0233004041,http://amzn.to/2kALBMs,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The Long Race to Glory: How the British Came to Rule the Cycling World,Search on Amazon
Moranthology,Caitlin Moran,,,,2017-02-08,"Fun. In digestible chunks. I liked the more serious writing more than the amusing throwaway stuff, but that was good too.",,091940885,http://amzn.to/2lsoIMD,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Moranthology,Search on Amazon
"The Hyperion Omnibus: Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion",Dan Simmons,,,,2017-04-17,"Epic. Got into the characters, as their stories played out, though did find some if it all a bit impenetrable, but I think that tends to be par for the course with this kind of mammoth Sci-Fi. There was poetry too, which leaves me cold. Not enough to put me off.",,0575076267,http://amzn.to/2pgLtFl,"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The Hyperion Omnibus: Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion",Search on Amazon
The Woman who Went to Bed for a Year,Sue Townsend,,,2017-04-20,2017-04-24,"Simply written and direct style makes it easy to read, but with a subtle cutting edge to the satire.

"Me: Moir, Vol. 1",Vic Reeves,,,2017-04-29,2017-05-27,"I like Jim Moir(Vic Reeves) - the book was likeable, but not as manically funny as the man. Had it lovely absurd moments. Suspect Vol. 2 will be more fun.",,014118955X,http://amzn.to/2tVDCeK,"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Me: Moir, Vol. 1",Search on Amazon
Hothouse,Brian Aldiss,,,2017-06-18,2017-06-24,Loved the ideas throughout. Great descriptions of the future planet and creative imaginining about future lifeforms. Really enjoyed the language.

Grayson Perry,Jacky Klein,,,2017-04-24,2017-07-01,"Really enjoyed this. Been such a long time since I'd read a big art book with lots of colour plates. There are tons in this one, all with cracking descriptions and explainations of the process of creating the work and the ideas behind them. The themed structure was really good too. Brilliant value for so much good art.",,0500290806,http://amzn.to/2wXX8JJ,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Grayson Perry,Search on Amazon

Non Stop,Brian Aldiss,,,2017-09-21,2017-08-17,"Took a while to get going, but the second half picked up. Suberbly well thought out and explained setting and great how it all came together. Much like 'Hothouse' it struck me as pretty promising film adaption material.",,1857989988,http://amzn.to/2woJ4ev,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Non Stop,Search on Amazon

The Establishment: And how they get away with it ,Owen Jones,,,,2017-10-16,Very well put together explanation of how things run and how depressingly connected and co-opted civic life has become in this country. Even despite the rallying cry for democratic revolution at the end it was all rather dispiriting.  A reaction which kind of emphasises his point. Thank God for the youngsters.,,0141974990,http://amzn.to/2gGRDvD,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The Establishment: And how they get away with it ,Search on Amazon

Out of Time,Miranda Sawyer,,,2017-11-02,2017-11-22,"As is often the case - a general feeling of having enjoyed a book without too much specific info. As we're similar ages, the references were fun but the general feel is pretty universal. Liked the style and glad I picked it up after listening to the Adam Buxton podcast about the book.",out-of-time.html,0007521073,http://amzn.to/2icV2Dp,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Out of Time,Search on Amazon
The Undercover Economist,Tim Harford,,,2017-06-15,2017-12-23,"Very readable and interesting. Very good on how markets can work. The chapter on how China transitioned from a command ecomnomy was fascinating. Made me look anew at markets as systems, that whilst not ideal are probably the best tool for lots of things - but with some pretty big caveats.",,0349119856,http://amzn.to/2C5bL49,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The Undercover Economist,Search on Amazon
In Defence of Food,Michael Pollan,2017-12-23,,2017-12-23,2017-12-27,"Eat Food, Not too Much, Mostly Plants. Summary from the book, but also a very revealing look at the state we're in when it comes to food. As is often the case with 'ideas' books that explain how things are there's quite a bit of depressing stuff, but enough optimism to balance it out.",,184614096X,http://amzn.to/2E8Tlg4,https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_2_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=In Defence of Food,Search on Amazon
