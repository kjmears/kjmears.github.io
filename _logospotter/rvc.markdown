Clearly spelling out the University's specialism highlighted in clear, bold Helvetica the most curious aspect is why the initials are turned 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Looking like a variant of [Avant Garde](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-avant-garde-gothic/) it isn't made any more interesting by the change in orientation, and I wonder why they eschewed the possibilities (if a little cliched) of some animal motif.
