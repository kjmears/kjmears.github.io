I've collected the sketchnotes I did at the <a href="http://www.handheldconf.com/2012/">Handheld 2012</a> conference. It was a really enjoyable day, even taking into consideration my nerves at breaking my conference speaking cherry. 

My slides from the day are available at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mearso/is-your-thinking-l-shaped">Speakerdeck</a>

There is a bigger version over at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mearso/8370787124/">flickr</a>
