Second drawing from @media2006 worked up into an illustration.

The bulletproof tag is an easy one to work up especially with all the talk in the air about design superheroes, and the cover of the book gives me all the colours I need.

All I had to do was get a look at the man himself.

I very much enjoyed the presentation. The emphasis on creating simple and robust methods to deliver elegant and appropriate designs. 

One example was the technique for the lovely graphic swirls on "cork'd":http://www.corkd.com/ setting the images wider than initially needed so as to be flexible later.

This is the original drawing that I worked from my sketchbook
