## Updated

A little bit about the [ideas behind the refresh][release] from the college, and a more detailed [roundup][agency], from Split, the agency that worked on it.

The previous logo was conceptual with a rather large C, and this new one is a much nicer marl altogether. I really like it's simplicity and think the explanation from Split's case study isn't a stretch - it **does** complete and distrupt.

I like it a lot.

## Previous Logo

![Old Logo](/images/unilogos/lcm-old.gif)

Called a Sound Signature, I like that this weird, abstract shape [has a provenance][vimeo], but I'm not sure how practical it might be. The choice of a condensed typeface is a pleasant enough, and modern in a rather generic way, but does feel a little like an afterthought compared to the image.
