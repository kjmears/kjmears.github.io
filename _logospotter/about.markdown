A collection of reviews and information about logos used by UK Universities. I thought it would be interesting, educational and enjoyable to gather examples and research a little more about the logos and the particluar demands of designing for this sector.

### Getting Started

Right now I am in the early stages of producing what I hope will be a useful and enlightening guide and as such would be happy for anyone to point out things they like or where I could improve "Use the form to get in touch":http://logospotter.co.uk/contact

I'm working through a series of early reviews for various logos and then hope to revisit them with more in depth information once I've got up to speed.
