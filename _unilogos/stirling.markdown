Description of the coat of arms in the [Visual Identity Guidelines](http://www.marketingtools.stir.ac.uk/documents/MarketingGuideVisualIdentityFeb08.pdf)

> The Coat of Arms may be described as an arched bridge topped by a tower and
> surrounded by open books. The bridge may represent a governor or magistrate,
> the tower safety and guardianship, while the open books have clear associations
> with learning and knowledge. The imagery portrays the University as an official
> guardian entrusted with the safekeeping of the process of imparting knowledge,
> while willingly serving the public.

Not sure about the depth of interpretation in the coat of arms, but the simple rendering makes for a pleasing contrast with the strong serifs in the typeface that I haven't been able to work out what it is.
