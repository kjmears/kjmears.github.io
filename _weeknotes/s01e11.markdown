The early stages of the current project. The time for working out what the hell we are trying to do and how we are going to do it. Been making progress by coming up with artifacts intended to be useful. I created a site plan identifying which bits of our current site we intend to Re-Make/Re-Model (a Roxy Music reference there). It was suprisingly hard to decide how much detail to go into - I didn't want it to just be a static reflection of what we have, but laid out so we can see just how much there is to do. I guess how often I go back a refer to it might be a good sign of how useful it is.

The sketching theme continued with me trying to make some sense of content requirements for a course page - sketching out the content types and priorities  helped me to communicate what I thought the page was. It turned out I'd misunderstood the requirements - but I think it was easier to realise that because I'd drawn it.

To complete my hattrick of UX sketching I then scribbled whilst me and a colleague worked out some user behaviours and what destinations made sense. It felt like a useful piece of work. It wasn't quite the UX Comics that recent follow [@almostexact](https://twitter.com/almostexact) has been [talking about](http://www.almostexact.com/2013/06/how-to-make-your-first-ux-comic-uxscotland-slides/) and have got me very intrigued. Just looking for opportunties to get started.

Other things that cropped up were an interesting discussion about a recent university redesign that is [worth a look](http://collegewebeditor.com/blog/index.php/archives/2014/05/15/whats-wrong-with-the-redesigned-bucknell-university-website/) (the article and the redesign).
