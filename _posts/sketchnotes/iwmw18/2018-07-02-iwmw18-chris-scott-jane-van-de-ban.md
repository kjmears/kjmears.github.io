Chris and Jane's talk about the use of customer journeys at Birbeck was a qualiity case study that I enjoyed mainly because it showed just how layered and hard it is to accurately model people's behaviours onto a pretty unique organisation. It's a wonder people manage to work this stuff out and make change happen. Birbeck and Headscape seem to have made a pretty good fist of it.

As an aside, it was a very honest moment to hear Chris say that he found the whole presenting thing pretty difficult, and later I also spoke to Jane who has made herself a very good public speaker by deliberate sustained effort. It was great to have them shatter the myth of the natural public speaker and make it more achieveable for everyone.
